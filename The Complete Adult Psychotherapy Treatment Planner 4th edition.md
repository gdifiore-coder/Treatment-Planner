## PRACTICEPLANNERS ® SERIES PREFACE

Accountability is an important dimension of the practice of psychotherapy. Treatment programs, public agencies, clinics, and practitioners must justify and document their treatment plans to outside review entities in order to be reimbursed for services. The books and software in the Practice Planners ® se- ries are designed to help practitioners fulfill these documentation requirements efficiently and professionally.

The Practice Planners ® series includes a wide array of treatment planning books including not only the original  Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner, Child Psychotherapy Treatment Planner,  and  Adolescent Psychotherapy Treatment Planner,  all now in their fourth editions, but also  Treatment Planners targeted to a wide range of specialty areas of practice, including:

- Addictions
- Co- occurring disorders
- Behavioral medicine
- College students
- Couples therapy
- Crisis counseling
- Early childhood education
- Employee assistance
- Family therapy
- Gays and lesbians
- Group therapy
- Juvenile justice and residential care
- Mental retardation and developmental disability
- Neuropsychology
- Older adults
- Parenting skills
- Pastoral counseling
- Personality disorders
- Probation and parole
- Psychopharmacology


---

- School counseling
- Severe and persistent mental illness
- Sexual abuse victims and offenders
- Special education

## • Suicide and homicide risk assessment

In addition, there are three branches of companion books which can be used in conjunction with the  Treatment Planners,  or on their own:

- Progress Notes Planners  provide a menu of progress statements that

elaborate on the client’s symptom presentation and the provider’s ther- apeutic intervention. Each  Progress Notes Planner  statement is directly integrated with the behavioral definitions and therapeutic interven- tions from its companion  Treatment Planner .

- Homework Planners  include homework assignments designed around

each presenting problem (such as anxiety, depression, chemical depen- dence, anger management, eating disorders, or panic disorder) that is the focus of a chapter in its corresponding  Treatment Planner .

- Client Education Handout Planners  provide brochures and handouts to

help educate and inform clients on presenting problems and mental health issues, as well as life skills techniques. The handouts are included on CD- ROMs for easy printing from your computer and are ideal for use in wait- ing rooms, at presentations, as newsletters, or as information for clients struggling with mental illness issues. The topics covered by these handouts correspond to the presenting problems in the  Treatment Planners.

### The series also includes:

- TheraScribe ®, the #1 selling treatment planning and clinical record-

keeping software system for mental health professionals. Thera Scribe ® allows the user to import the data from any of the  Treatment Planner, Progress Notes Planner,  or Homework Planner  books into the software’s expandable database to simply point and click to create a detailed, orga- nized, individualized, and customized treatment plan along with optional integrated progress notes and homework assignments.

Adjunctive books, such as  The Psychotherapy Documentation Primer  and  The Clinical Documentation Sourcebook  contain forms and resources to aid the clinician in mental health practice management.

The goal of our series is to provide practitioners with the resources they need in order to provide high quality care in the era of accountability. To put it simply: we seek to help you spend more time on patients, and less time on paperwork.

I have learned that it is better to acknowledge your weaknesses and to seek out those who complement you with their strengths. I was fortunate enough to have found the right person who brings his expertise in Evidence-Based Treat- ment to this project. He has contributed wisely and thoughtfully to greatly im- prove our  Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  through his well- informed edits and additions to our content, to bring it in line with the latest psychotherapy research. He has been thoroughly professional in his approach while being a joy to work with, due to his wonderful sense of humor. I have said to many people since beginning this revision, “This guy really knows the literature!” For a person like me, who has spent his career in the psychotherapy trenches, it is a pleasure to get back in touch with my science-based roots by working with a Boulder Model clinician-scientist. I take my hat off to you, Dr. Tim Bruce. You have taken our product to a new level of contribution to the clinicians who are looking for Evidence-Based Treatment guidance. Your students are fortunate to have you for a mentor and we are fortunate to have you for a Contributing Editor. Thank you!

I want to acknowledge how honored I am to have had this chance to work with Art Jongsma, his colleague Sue Rhoda, and the staff at John Wiley and Sons on these, their well- known and highly regarded, treatment planners. These planners are widely recognized as works of enormous value to practic- ing clinicians as well as great educational tools for students of our profession. I didn’t know Art when he asked me if I would join him on these editions, and the task he had in mind, to help empirically inform objectives and interven- tions, was daunting. I knew it would be a challenge to retain the rich breadth of options that Art has offered in past editions while simultaneously trying to identify and describe the fundamental features of identified empirically sup- ported treatments. Although I have trained in empirically supported treatment approaches, contributed to this literature, and used them throughout my pro- fessional career, I recognize that our product will be open to criticism. I can

say that we have done our best to offer a resource to our colleagues and their clients that is practical, flexible, and appreciates the complexities of any of the treatment approaches it conveys. And in the process of working with Art and Sue toward these goals, I have found them not only to be consummate profes- sionals, but also thoughtful, conscientious, and kind persons. It has been a great pleasure working with you, Art and Sue, and a privilege to call you my friends.

## INTRODUCTION

## ABOUT PRACTICE PLANNERS ®TREATMENT PLANNERS

Pressure from third-party payors, accrediting agencies, and other outside par- ties has increased the need for clinicians to quickly produce effective, high- quality treatment plans.  Treatment Planners  provide all the elements necessary to quickly and easily develop formal treatments plans that satisfy the needs of most third-party payors and state and federal review agencies. Each  Treatment Planner:

- Saves you hours of time- consuming paperwork.
- Offers the freedom to develop customized treatment plans.
- Includes over 1,000 clear statements describing the behavioral manifesta-

tions of each relational problem, and includes long-term goals, short-term objectives, and clinically tested treatment options.

- Has an easy- to- use reference format that helps locate treatment

### plan components by behavioral problem or DSM-IV™ diagnosis.

As with the rest of the books in the Practice Planners® series, our aim is to clarify, simplify, and accelerate the treatment planning process, so you spend less time on paperwork, and more time with your clients.

## HOW TO USE THIS TREATMENT PLANNER

Use this  Treatment Planner  to write treatment plans according to the following progression of six steps:

1. Problem Selection.  Although the client may discuss a variety of issues dur-

ing the assessment, the clinician must determine the most significant prob- lems on which to focus the treatment process. Usually a primary problem will surface, and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other problems may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treat-

ment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few selected problems or treatment will lose its direction. Choose the problem within this  Planner  which most accurately represents your client’s present- ing issues.

2. Problem Definition.  Each client presents with unique nuances as to how a

problem behaviorally reveals itself in his or her life. Therefore, each prob- lem that is selected for treatment focus requires a specific definition about how it is evidenced in the particular client. The symptom pattern should be associated with diagnostic criteria and codes such as those found in the DSM- IV  or the International Classification of Diseases. This  Planner  of- fers such behaviorally specific definition statements to choose from or to serve as a model for your own personally crafted statements.

3. Goal Development.  The next step in developing your treatment plan is to

set broad goals for the resolution of the target problem. These statements need not be crafted in measurable terms but can be global, long-term goals that indicate a desired positive outcome to the treatment procedures. This Planner  provides several possible goal statements for each problem, but one statement is all that is required in a treatment plan.

4. Objective Construction.  In contrast to long- term goals, objectives must be

stated in behaviorally measurable language so that it is clear to review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed care organiza- tions when the client has achieved the established objectives. The objec- tives presented in this  Planner  are designed to meet this demand for accountability. Numerous alternatives are presented to allow construction of a variety of treatment plan possibilities for the same presenting prob- lem.

5. Intervention Creation.  Interventions are the actions of the clinician de-

signed to help the client complete the objectives. There should be at least one intervention for every objective. If the client does not accomplish the objective after the initial intervention, new interventions should be added to the plan. Interventions should be selected on the basis of the client’s needs and the treatment provider’s full therapeutic repertoire. This  Plan- ner  contains interventions from a broad range of therapeutic approaches, and we encourage the provider to write other interventions reflecting his or her own training and experience.

Some suggested interventions listed in the  Planner  refer to specific books that can be assigned to the client for adjunctive bibliotherapy. Ap- pendix A contains a full bibliographic reference list of these materials, including these two popular choices:  Read Two Books and Let’s Talk Next Week: Using Bibliotherapy in Clinical Practice  (2000) by Maidman and DiMenna and  Rent Two Films and Let’s Talk in the Morning: Using Popu- lar Movies in Psychotherapy, Second Edition  (2001) by Hesley and Hes- ley (both books are published by Wiley).

6. Diagnosis Determination.  The determination of an appropriate diagno-

sis is based on an evaluation of the client’s complete clinical presenta- tion. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal symptoms that the client presents with the criteria for diagnosis of a mental illness condition as described in  DSM- IV. Despite arguments made against diagnosing clients in this manner, diagnosis is a reality that exists in the world of mental health care, and it is a necessity for third- party reimbursement. It is the clinician’s thorough knowledge of DSM- IV  criteria and a complete understanding of the client assessment data that contribute to the most reliable, valid diagnosis.

Congratulations! After completing these six steps, you should have a compre- hensive and individualized treatment plan ready for immediate implementa- tion and presentation to the client. A sample treatment plan for borderline personality is provided at the end of this introduction.

**INCORPORATING EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT INTO THE  TREATMENT  PLANNER**

Evidence- based treatment (that is, treatment which is scientifically shown in research trials to be efficacious) is rapidly becoming of critical importance to the mental health community as insurance companies are beginning to offer preferential pay to organizations using it. In fact, the APA Division 12 (Soci- ety of Clinical Psychology) lists of empirically supported treatments have been referenced by a number of local, state and federal funding agencies, which are beginning to restrict reimbursement to these treatments, as are some managed- care and insurance companies.

In this fourth edition of  The  Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  we have made an effort to empirically inform some chapters by high- lighting Short-term Objectives (STOs) and Therapeutic Interventions (TIs) that are consistent with therapies that have demonstrated efficacy through em- pirical study. Watch for this icon as an indication that an Objective/Interven- tion is consistent with those found in evidence-based treatments.

## E BT

References to their empirical support have been included in the reference sec- tion as Appendix B. Reviews of efforts to identify evidence-based therapies (EBT), including the effort’s benefits and limitations can be found in Bruce and Sanderson (2005), Chambless and colleagues (1996, 1998), and Chamb- less and Ollendick (2001). References have also been included to therapist- and client- oriented treatment manuals and books that describe the step-by- step use

of noted EBTs or treatments consistent with their objectives and interventions. Of course, recognizing that there are STOs and TIs that practicing clinicians have found useful but that have not yet received empirical scrutiny, we have in- cluded those that reflect common practice among experienced clinicians. The goal is to provide a range of treatment plan options, some studied empirically, others refl ecting common clinical practice, so the user can construct what they believe to be the best plan for their particular client.

In many instances, EBTs are short-term, problem- oriented treatments that focus on improving current problems  / symptoms related to a client’s cur- rent distress and disability. Accordingly, STOs and TIs of that type have been placed earlier in the sequence of STO and TI options. In addition, some STOs and TIs reflect core components of the EBT approach that are always de- livered (e.g., exposure to feared objects and situations for a phobic disorder; behavioral activation for depression). Others reflect adjuncts to treatment that are commonly used to address problems that may not always be a feature of the clinical picture (e.g., assertive communication skills training for the social anxious or depressed client whose difficulty with assertion appears contribu- tory to the primary anxiety or depressive disorder). Most of the STOs and TIs associated with the EBTs are described at a level of detail that permits flex- ibility and adaptability in their specific application. As with previous editions of this  Treatment Planner,  each chapter also includes the option to add STOs and TIs that are not listed.

### Criteria for Inclusion of Evidence-Based Therapies

Not every treatment that has undergone empirical study for a mental health problem is included in this edition. In general, we have included EBTs the em- pirical support for which has either been well established or demonstrated at more than a preliminary level as defined by those authors who have under- taken the task of identifying EBTs, such as Chambless and colleagues (1996,

1998. and Nathan and Gorman (1998, 2002). At minimum, this requires dem-

onstration of efficacy through a clinical trial or large clinical replication series that have features reflective of good experimental design (e.g., random assign- ment, blind assignments, reliable and valid measurement, clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, state- of- the- art diagnostic methods, and adequate sample size). Well established EBTs typically have more than one of these types of studies demonstrating their efficacy as well as other desirable features, such as demonstration of effi cacy by independent research groups and specification of client characteristics for which the treatment was effective. Because treatment literatures for various problems develop at different paces, treatment STOs and TIs that have been included may have the most empirical support for their problem area, but less than that found in more heavily studied areas. For ex- ample, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has the highest level of empirical


---

## INTRODUCTION  5

support of tested psychotherapies for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), but that level of evidence is lower than that supporting, for example, exposure- based therapy for phobic fear and avoidance. The latter has simply been stud- ied more extensively, so there are more controlled trials, independent replica- tions, and the like. Nonetheless, within the psychotherapy outcome literature for BPD, DBT clearly has the highest level of evidence supporting its efficacy and usefulness. Accordingly, STOs and TIs consistent with DBT have been included in this edition. Lastly, just as some of the STOs and TIs included in this edition reflect common clinical practices of experienced clinicians, those associated with EBTs reflect what is commonly practiced by clinicians that use EBTs.

Summary of Required and Preferred EBT Inclusion Criteria

Required

- Demonstration of efficacy through at least one randomized controlled

trial with good experimental design, or

- Demonstration of efficacy through a large, well- designed clinical replica-

tion series.

Preferred

- Efficacy has been shown by more than one study.
- Efficacy has been demonstrated by independent research groups.
- Client characteristics for which the treatment was effective were speci-

fi ed.

### • A clear description of the treatment was available.

There does remain considerable debate regarding evidence- based treatment amongst mental health professionals who are not always in agreement regard- ing the best treatments or how to weigh the factors that contribute to good outcomes. Some practitioners are skeptical about the wisdom of changing their practice on the basis of research evidence, and their reluctance is fuelled by the methodological problems of psychotherapy research. Our goal in this book is to provide a range of treatment plan options, some studied empirically, others refl ecting common clinical practice, so the user can construct what they believe to be the best plan for their particular client. As indicated earlier, rec- ognizing that there are interventions which practicing clinicians have found useful but that have not yet received empirical scrutiny, we have included those that refl ect common practice among experienced clinicians.

## 6 THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER

## A FINAL NOTE ON TAILORING THE TREATMENT PLAN TO THE CLIENT

One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client’s problems and needs. Treatment plans should not be mass-produced, even if clients have similar problems. The indi- vidual’s strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, social network, family cir- cumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treat- ment strategy. Drawing upon our own years of clinical experience, we have put together a variety of treatment choices. These statements can be combined in thousands of permutations to develop detailed treatment plans. Relying on their own good judgment, clinicians can easily select the statements that are appropriate for the individuals whom they are treating. In addition, we en- courage readers to add their own definitions, goals, objectives, and interven- tions to the existing samples. As with all of the books in the  Treatment Plan- ners  series, it is our hope that this book will help promote effective, creative treatment planning—a process that will ultimately benefit the client, clinician, and mental health community.
