## • Women’s issues

In addition, there are three branches of companion books that can be used in conjunction with the  Treatment Planners, or on their own:

- Progress Notes Planners  provide a menu of progress statements that

elaborate  on  the  client’s  symptom  presentation  and  the  provider’s therapeutic  intervention.  Each  Progress  Notes  Planner  statement  is directly  integrated  with  the  behavioral  definitions  and  therapeutic interventions from its companion  Treatment Planner .

- Homework Planners  include homework assignments designed around

each presenting problem (such as anxiety, depression, substance use, anger control problems, eating disorders, or panic disorder) that is the focus of a chapter in its corresponding  Treatment Planner .

- Client Education Handout Planners  provide brochures and handouts to

help educate and inform clients on presenting problems and mental health issues, as well as life skills techniques. The handouts are included on CD-ROMs for easy printing from your computer and are ideal for use in waiting rooms, at presentations, as newsletters, or as information for clients struggling with mental illness issues. The topics covered by these handouts correspond to the presenting problems in the  Treatment Planners .

The series also includes adjunctive books, such as  The Psychotherapy Docu- mentation Primer  and  The Clinical Documentation Sourcebook , contain forms and resources to aid the clinician in mental health practice management. The goal of our series is to provide practitioners with the resources they need in order to provide high-quality care in the era of accountability. To put it simply: We seek to help you spend more time on patients, and less time on paperwork.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Since 2005 we have turned to research evidence to inform the treatment Objectives and Interventions in our latest editions of the  Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  books. While much of the content of our  Planners  was “best  practice”  and  also  from  the  mainstream  of sound  psychological procedure, we have benefited significantly from a thorough review that looked through the lens of evidence-based practice. The later editions of the Planners  now stand as content not just based on “best practice” but based on reliable research results. Although several of my coauthors have contributed to this recertification of our content, Timothy J. Bruce has been the main guiding force behind this effort. I am very proud of the highly professional content provided by so many coauthors who are leaders in their respective subspecialties in the field of psychology such as addiction, family therapy, couples therapy, personality disorder treatment, group treatment, women’s issues, military personnel treatment, older adult treatment, and many others. Added to this expertise over the past 7 years has been the contribution of Dr. Tim  Bruce  who  has  used  his  depth  of knowledge  regarding  evidence- supported treatment to shape and inform the content of the last two editions of Adult, Adolescent, Child , and  Addiction Psychotherapy Treatment Planners . I welcome Tim aboard as an author for these books and consider it an honor to have him as a friend, colleague, and coauthor.

I must also add my acknowledgment of the supportive professionalism of the Wiley staff, especially that of my editor, Marquita Flemming. Wiley has been a trusted partner in this series for almost 20 years now and I am blessed to be published by such a highly respected company. Thank you to all my friends at Wiley!

And then there is our manuscript manager, Sue Rhoda, who knows just what to do to make a document presentable right up to the standards required by a publisher. Thank you, Sue.

Finally, I tip my hat to my coauthor, Mark Peterson, who launched this Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  with his original content contributions many years ago and has supported all the efforts to keep it fresh and evidence- based.

## AEJ

I am fortunate to have been invited some seven years ago by Dr. Art Jongsma  to work  with  him  on  his  well-known  and  highly  regarded Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  series and now to be welcomed as one of his coauthors on this  Planner  along with Mark Peterson. As readers know, Art’s treatment planners are highly regarded as works of enormous value to practicing clinicians as well as terrific educational tools for “students” of our profession. That Art’s brainchild would have this type of value to our field is no surprise when you work with him. He is the consummate psychologist, with enormous breadth and depth of experience, a profound intellect, and a Rogerian capacity for empathy and understanding—all of which he would modestly deny. When you work with Art you not only get to know him, you get to know his family, colleagues, and friends. In doing so, you get to know his values. If you are like me, you have relationships that you prize because they are with people whom you know to be, simply stated, good. Well, to use an expression I grew up with, Art is good people. And it is my honor to have him as a friend, colleague, and coauthor. Thank you, Art!

I also would like thank Marquita Flemming and the staff at Wiley & Sons for their immeasurable support, guidance, and professionalism. It is just my opinion, but I think Marquita should publish her own book on author relations.

I would also like to extend a big thank-you to our manuscript manager, Sue Rhoda, for her exacting work and (needed) patience. In fact, I am sure Sue  will  take  it in stride  when  we  ask  to do  one  more  edit  of this acknowledgment section after it has been “finalized.”

Lastly, I would like thank my wife, Lori, and our children, Logan and Madeline, for all they do. They’re good people, too.

## INTRODUCTION

## ABOUT PRACTICE  PLANNERS ® TREATMENT PLANNERS

Pressure from third-party payors, accrediting agencies, and other outside parties has increased the need for clinicians to quickly produce effective, high-quality treatment plans.

Each  Treatment Planner:

- Saves you hours of time-consuming paperwork.
- Offers the freedom to develop customized treatment plans.
- Includes over 1,000 clear statements describing the behavioral manifes-

tations of each relational problem, and includes long-term goals, short- term objectives, and clinically tested treatment options.

- Has an easy-to-use reference format that helps locate treatment plan

## components by behavioral problem.

As with the rest of the books in the Practice Planners ® series, our aim is to clarify, simplify, and accelerate the treatment planning process so you spend less time on paperwork and more time with your clients.

Evidence-based practice (EBP) is steadily becoming the standard of care in mental healthcare as it has in medical healthcare. Professional organizations such as the American Psychological Association, National Association of Social  Workers,  and  the  American  Psychiatric  Association,  as well  as consumer organizations such the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) have endorsed the use of EBP. In some practice settings, EBP is becoming mandated. It is clear that the call for evidence and accountability is being increasingly sounded. So, what is EBP and how is its use facilitated by this  Planner ?

Borrowing  from  the  Institute  of Medicine’s  definition  (Institute  of Medicine, 2001), the American Psychological Association (APA) has defined EBP as, “the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences” (APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, 2006). Consistent with this definition, we have identified those psychological treatments with the best  available  supporting  evidence,  added  Objectives  and  Interventions consistent with them in the pertinent chapters, and identified these with this symbol:  . As most practitioners know, research has shown that although these  treatment  methods  have  demonstrated  efficacy  (e.g.,  Nathan  & Gorman,  2007),  the  individual  psychologist  (e.g.,  Wampold,  2001),  the treatment relationship (e.g., Norcross, 2002), and the patient (e.g., Bohart & Tallman, 1999) are also vital contributors to the success of psychotherapy. As noted by the APA, “Comprehensive evidence-based practice will consider all of these determinants and their optimal combinations” (APA, 2006, p. 275). For more information and instruction on constructing evidence- based psychotherapy treatment plans, see our DVD-based training series entitled  Evidence-based  Psychotherapy  Treatment  Planning  (Jongsma  & Bruce, 2010–2012).

## INTRODUCTION  3

The sources listed in Appendix B: Professional References and used to identify the evidence-based treatments integrated into this  Planner  are many. They include supportive studies from the psychotherapy outcome literature, current expert individual, group, and organizational reviews, as well as evidence-based practice guideline recommendations. Examples of specific sources used include the Cochrane Collaboration reviews, the work of the Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12 of the American Psychological Association)  identifying  research-supported  psychological  treatments, evidence-based treatment reviews such as those in Nathan and Gorman’s  A Guide to Treatments That Work  and the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA)  National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs  and  Practices  [NREPP],  as well  as evidence-based  practice guidelines from professional organizations such as the American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in Great Britain, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to name a few. Although each of these sources uses its own criteria for judging levels of empirical support for any given treatment, we favored those that use more rigorous  criteria  typically  requiring  demonstration  of efficacy  through randomized controlled trials or clinical replication series, good experimental design, and independent replication. Our approach was to evaluate these various sources and include those treatments supported by the highest level of evidence  and  for  which  there  was  consensus  in conclusions  and recommendations. For any chapter in which EBP is identified, references to the sources used are listed in Appendix B: Professional References and can be consulted by those interested for further information regarding criteria and conclusions. In addition to these references, this appendix also includes references to Clinical Resources. Clinical Resources are books, manuals, and other resources for clinicians that describe the details of the application or “how to” of the treatment approaches described in a chapter. There is debate regarding evidence-based practice among mental health professionals who are not always in agreement regarding the best treatment or how to weigh the factors that contribute to good outcomes. Some practitioners are skeptical about changing their practice on the basis of research evidence, and their reluctance is fueled by the methodological challenges and problems inherent in psychotherapy research. Our intent in this book is to accommodate these  differences  by  providing  a range  of treatment  plan  options,  some supported by the evidence-based value of “best available research” (APA, 2006), others reflecting common clinical practices of experienced clinicians, and still others representing emerging approaches so the user can construct what they believe to be the best plan for their particular client. Each of the chapters in this edition has also been reviewed with the goal of integrating homework exercise options into the Interventions. Many (but not all) of the client homework exercise suggestions were taken from and can be found in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  (Jongsma,

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER4

2014). You will find many more homework assignments suggested in this fifth edition of the  Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  than in previous editions.

The Bibliotherapy Suggestions Appendix A of this  Planner  has been significantly expanded and updated from previous editions. It includes many recently published offerings as well as more recent editions of books cited in our earlier editions. All of the self-help books and client workbooks cited in the chapter Interventions are listed in this appendix. There are also many additional books listed that are supportive of the treatment approaches described in the respective chapters. Each chapter has a list of self-help books consistent with its topic and listed in this appendix. In its final report entitled  Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America,  The President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health called for recovery to be the “common, recognized outcome of mental health services” (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). To  define  recovery,  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services Administration  (SAMHSA)  within  the  U.S.  Department  of Health  and Human Services and the Interagency Committee on Disability Research in partnership with six other Federal agencies convened the National Consensus Conference  on  Mental  Health  Recovery  and  Mental  Health  Systems Transformation (SAMHSA, 2004). Over 110 expert panelists participated including mental health consumers, family members, providers, advocates, researchers, academicians, managed care representatives, accreditation bodies, State and local public officials, and others. From these deliberations, the following consensus statement was derived:

Mental health recovery is a journey of healing and transformation for a person with a mental health problem to be able to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve maximum human potential. Recovery is a multi-faceted concept based on the following 10 fundamental elements and guiding principles:

- Self-direction
- Individualized and person-centered
- Empowerment
- Holistic
- Nonlinear
- Strengths-based
- Peer support
- Respect
- Responsibility

## • Hope

These principles are defined in Appendix C. We have also created a set of Goal, Objective, and Intervention statements that reflect these 10 principles.


---

## INTRODUCTION  5

The clinician who desires to insert into the client treatment plan specific statements reflecting a Recovery Model orientation may choose from this list. In addition to this list, we believe that many of the Goal, Objective, and Intervention statements found in the chapters reflect a recovery orientation. For example, our assessment interventions are meant to identify how the problem affects this unique client and the strengths that the client brings to the treatment. Additionally, an intervention statement such as, “Review with the client the success he/she has had and the sources of love and concern that exist in his/her life,” from the Suicidal Ideation chapter, is evidence that recovery model content permeates items listed throughout our chapters. However, if the clinician desires a more focused set of statements directly related to each principle guiding the recovery model, they can be found in Appendix C.

We have done a bit of reorganizing of chapter content for this edition. We have renamed the Depression chapter as Unipolar Depression. This makes it distinct from the new chapter written for Bipolar Disorder— Depression. We also renamed the Mania/Hypomania chapter as Bipolar Disorder—Mania to be a companion to the Bipolar Disorder—Depression chapter. You will note that some of the content from the Bipolar Disorder— Depression chapter is repeated in the Bipolar Disorder—Mania chapter, but that the EBT symbol may or may not be present for the same content. This is done to indicate that the particular EBP has support for its efficacy on that particular chapter’s problem (e.g., symptoms of mania), but not necessarily on other aspects of the disorder (e.g., symptoms of bipolar depression). If more information is desired regarding the specific effects of any evidence- based treatment, one can find them by consulting the references to empirical support for that chapter in the Professional References Appendix. Finally, we  have  deleted  the  Chemical  Dependence—Relapse  chapter  from  this edition  because  the  relapse  issue  is now  adequately  dealt  with  in the Substance Use chapter and most of the other components of the Relapse chapter were redundant with those in the Substance Use chapter. The Cognitive Deficits chapter was thoroughly revised by an invited expert in the Rehabilitation Psychology field, Dr. Michele Rusin. Dr. Rusin has extensive experience in providing treatment for clients who present with cognitive deficits resulting from brain trauma or medical conditions. She is the primary author of the  Rehabilitation Psychology Treatment Planner , one of the books in the Practice Planner  series. She has supplied guidance for the general practitioner in assessing and providing first-level treatment for mild cognitive deficits. Obviously, if more severe symptoms present themselves the client must be referred to a psychology and medical specialist for more in-depth therapy.

With the publication of the  DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), we have updated the Diagnostic Suggestions listed at the end of each chapter. The  DSM-IV-TR  (APA, 2000) was used in previous editions of this  Planner. Although many of the diagnostic labels and codes remain the


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER6

same, several have changed with the publication of the  DSM-5 and are reflected in this  Planner .

Some clinicians have asked that the Objective statements in this  Planner be written such that the client’s attainment of the Objective can be measured. We  have  written  our  Objectives  in behavioral  terms  and  many  are measurable as written. For example, this Objective from the Anxiety chapter is one that is measurable as written because it either can be done or it cannot: “Verbalize  an  understanding  of the  role  that  cognitive  biases  play  in excessive irrational worry and persistent anxiety symptoms.” But at times the statements  are  too  broad  to be  considered  measurable.  Consider,  for example, this Objective from the Anxiety chapter: “Identify, challenge, and replace biased, fearful self-talk with positive, realistic, and empowering self- talk.” To make it quantifiable a clinician might modify it to read, “Give two examples of identifying, challenging, and replacing biased, fearful self-talk with positive, realistic, and empowering self-talk.” Clearly, the use of two examples is arbitrary, but it does allow for a quantifiable measurement of the attainment of the Objective. Or consider this example from the Anxiety chapter: “Identify and engage in pleasant activities on a daily basis.” To make it more measurable the clinician might simply add a desired target number of pleasant activities, thus: “Identify and report engagement in two pleasant activities on a daily basis.” The exact target number that the client is to attain is subjective and should be selected by the individual clinician in consultation with the client. Once the exact target number is determined, then our content can be very easily modified to fit the specific treatment situation. For more information on psychotherapy treatment plan writing, see Jongsma (2005).

Finally, we have added Appendix D which provides an alphabetical index of the sources for assessment instruments and clinical interview forms cited in interventions. We hope that this appendix allows the reader to find these resources easily if he/she wants to add them to a treatment plan. We hope you find these improvements to this fifth edition of the  Planner useful to your treatment planning needs.

## HOW TO USE THIS TREATMENT PLANNER

Use  this  Treatment  Planner  to write  treatment  plans  according  to the following progression of six steps:

1. Problem Selection.  Although the client may discuss a variety of issues

during the assessment, the clinician must determine the most significant problems on which to focus the treatment process. Usually a primary problem will surface, and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other problems may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal


---

## INTRODUCTION  7

with a few selected problems or treatment will lose its direction. Choose the problem within this  Planner  that most accurately represents your client’s presenting issues.

2. Problem Definition.  Each client presents with unique nuances as to how

a problem behaviorally reveals itself in his or her life. Therefore, each problem that is selected for treatment focus requires a specific definition about how it is evidenced in the particular client. The symptom pattern should be associated with diagnostic criteria and codes such as those found in the  DSM-5 or the International Classification of Diseases. This Planner  offers such behaviorally specific definition statements to choose from or to serve as a model for your own personally crafted statements.

3. Goal Development.  The next step in developing your treatment plan is to

set  broad  goals  for  the  resolution  of the  target  problem.  These statements need not be crafted in measurable terms but can be global, long-term goals that indicate a desired positive outcome to the treatment procedures. This  Planner  provides several possible goal statements for each problem, but one statement is all that is required in a treatment plan.

4. Objective Construction.  In contrast to long-term goals, objectives must

be stated in behaviorally measurable language so that it is clear to review agencies,  health  maintenance  organizations,  and  managed  care organizations when the client has achieved the established objectives. The objectives presented in this  Planner  are designed to meet this demand  for  accountability.  Numerous  alternatives  are  presented  to allow construction of a variety of treatment plan possibilities for the same presenting problem.

5. Intervention  Creation.  Interventions  are  the  actions  of the  clinician

designed to help the client complete the objectives. There should be at least  one  intervention  for  every  objective.  If the  client  does  not accomplish the objective after the initial intervention, new interventions should be added to the plan. Interventions should be selected on the basis of the client’s needs and strengths and the treatment provider’s full therapeutic repertoire. This  Planner  contains interventions from a broad range of therapeutic approaches, and we encourage the provider to write other interventions reflecting his or her own training and experience. Some suggested interventions listed in the  Planner  refer to specific books that can be assigned to the client for adjunctive bibliotherapy. Appendix B contains a full bibliographic reference list of these materials, including these two popular choices:  Read Two Books and Let’s Talk Next Week: Using Bibliotherapy in Clinical Practice  by Maidman, Joshua, and DiMenna and  Rent Two Films and Let’s Talk in the Morning: Using Popular Movies in Psychotherapy, Second Edition  by Hesley and Hesley (both books are published by Wiley). For further information about self- help  books,  mental  health  professionals  may  wish  to consult  the


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER8

Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, Revised Edition  (Norcross et al., 2003).

6. Diagnosis Determination.  The determination of an appropriate diagnosis

is based on an evaluation of the client’s complete clinical presentation. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal symptoms that the client presents with the criteria for diagnosis of a mental illness condition as described in  DSM- 5. Despite arguments against diagnosing clients in this manner, diagnosis is a reality that exists in the world of mental health care, and it is a necessity for third-party reimbursement. It is the clinician’s thorough knowledge of DSM-5 criteria and a complete understanding of the client assessment data that contribute to the most reliable, valid diagnosis.

Congratulations!  After  completing  these  six  steps,  you  should  have  a comprehensive  and  individualized  treatment  plan  ready  for  immediate implementation and presentation to the client. A sample treatment plan for Anxiety is provided at the end of this introduction.

## A FINAL NOTE ON TAILORING THE TREATMENT PLAN TO THE CLIENT

One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client’s problems and needs. Treatment plans should not be mass-produced, even if clients have similar problems. The individual’s strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treatment strategy. Drawing upon our own years of clinical experience and the best available research, we have put together a variety of treatment choices. These statements can be combined in thousands of permutations to develop detailed treatment plans. Relying on their own good judgment, clinicians can easily select the statements that are appropriate for the individuals whom they are treating. In addition, we encourage readers to add their own definitions, goals, objectives, and interventions to the existing samples. As with all of the books in the  Treatment Planner  series, it is our hope that this book will help promote effective, creative treatment planning—a process that will ultimately benefit the client, clinician, and mental health community.

## SAMPLE TREATMENT PLAN

## ANXIETY

Definitions:  Excessive and/or unrealistic worry that is difficult to control occurring more days than not for at least 6 months about a number of events or activities.

Motor tension (e.g., restlessness, tiredness, shakiness, muscle tension).

Autonomic  hyperactivity  (e.g.,  palpitations,  shortness  of breath, dry mouth, trouble swallowing, nausea, diarrhea).

Hypervigilance (e.g., feeling constantly on edge, experiencing concentration difficulties, having trouble falling or staying asleep, exhibiting a general state of irritability).

Goals:  Reduce overall frequency, intensity, and duration of the anxiety so that daily functioning is not impaired.

Learn and implement coping skills that result in a reduction of anxiety and worry, and improved daily functioning.

## OBJECTIVES  INTERVENTIONS

## 1. Describe situations, thoughts,

feelings, and actions associated with anxieties and worries, their impact on functioning, and attempts to resolve them.

## 1. Focus on developing a level of

trust with the client; provide support and empathy to encourage the client to feel safe in expressing his/her GAD symptoms.

## 2. Ask the client to describe his/her

past experiences of anxiety and their impact on functioning; assess the focus, excessiveness, and uncontrollability of the worry and the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of his/her anxiety symptoms (consider using a structured interview such as The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule–Adult Version ).

## 2. Verbalize an understanding of

the cognitive, physiological, and behavioral components of anxiety and its treatment.

## 1. Discuss how generalized anxiety

typically involves excessive worry about unrealistic threats, various bodily expressions of


---

## INTRODUCTION  11

tension, overarousal, and hypervigilance, and avoidance of what is threatening that interact to maintain the problem (see Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry—Therapist Guide  by Zinbarg, Craske, and Barlow; Treating GAD  by Rygh and Sanderson).

## 2. Discuss how treatment targets

worry, anxiety symptoms, and avoidance to help the client manage worry effectively, reduce overarousal, and eliminate unnecessary avoidance.

## 3. Assign the client to read

psychoeducational sections of books or treatment manuals on worry and generalized anxiety (e.g.,  Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry—Workbook  by Craske and Barlow;  Overcoming Generalized Anxiety Disorder  by White).

3. Learn and implement calming

skills to reduce overall anxiety and manage anxiety symptoms.

## 1. Teach the client calming/

relaxation skills (e.g., applied relaxation, progressive muscle relaxation, cue controlled relaxation; mindful breathing; biofeedback) and how to discriminate better between relaxation and tension; teach the client how to apply these skills to his/her daily life (e.g.,  New Directions in Progressive Muscle Relaxation  by Bernstein, Borkovec, and Hazlett-Stevens; Treating GAD  by Rygh and Sanderson).

## 2. Assign the client homework each

session in which he/she practices relaxation exercises daily, gradually applying them


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER12

progressively from non-anxiety- provoking to anxiety-provoking situations; review and reinforce success while providing corrective feedback toward improvement.

## 4. Learn and implement a strategy

to limit the association between various environmental settings and worry, delaying the worry until a designated “worry time.”

## 1. Explain the rationale for using a

worry time as well as how it is to be used; agree upon a worry time with the client and implement.

## 2. Teach the client how to

recognize, stop, and postpone worry to the agreed-upon worry time using skills such as thought stopping, relaxation, and redirecting attention (or assign “Making Use of the Thought- Stopping Technique” and/or “Worry Time” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma to assist skill development); encourage use in daily life; review and reinforce success while providing corrective feedback toward improvement.

## 5. Verbalize an understanding of

the role that cognitive biases play in excessive irrational worry and persistent anxiety symptoms.

## 1. Assist the client in analyzing

his/her worries by examining potential biases such as the probability of the negative expectation occurring, the real consequences of it occurring, his/her ability to control the outcome, the worst possible outcome, and his/her ability to accept it (see “Analyze the Probability of a Feared Event” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma; Cognitive Therapy of Anxiety Disorders  by Clark and Beck).


---

## INTRODUCTION  13

6. Identify, challenge, and replace

biased, fearful self-talk with positive, realistic, and empowering self-talk.

## 1. Explore the client’s schema and

self-talk that mediate his/her fear response; assist him/her in challenging the biases; replacing the distorted messages with reality-based alternatives and positive, realistic self-talk that will increase his/her self- confidence in coping with irrational fears (see  Cognitive Therapy of Anxiety Disorders  by Clark and Beck).

## 2. Assign the client a homework

exercise in which he/she identifies fearful self-talk, identifies biases in the self-talk, generates alternatives, and tests through behavioral experiments (or assign “Negative Thoughts Trigger Negative Feelings” in the Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma); review and reinforce success, providing corrective feedback toward improvement.

## 1. Work cooperatively with the

therapist to identify situations, thoughts, and feelings associated with anger, angry verbal and/or behavioral actions, and the targets of those actions. (1, 2)

## 1. Develop a level of trust with the

client; provide support and empathy to encourage the client to feel safe in expressing his/her angry emotions as well as the impact anger expression has had


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER16

on his/her life as the interview focuses on the impact of anger on the client’s life.

## 2. As the client describes his/her

history and nature of anger issues in his/her own words, thoroughly assess the various stimuli (e.g., situations, people, thoughts) that have triggered the client’s anger and the thoughts, feelings, and actions that have characterized his/her anger responses.

2. Complete psychological testing

or objective questionnaires for assessing anger expression. (3)

## 3. Administer to the client

psychometric instruments designed to objectively assess anger expression (e.g.,  Anger, Irritability, and Assault Questionnaire ; Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory ; State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory ); give the client feedback regarding the results of the assessment; re- administer as indicated to assess treatment response.

## 3. Cooperate with a medical

evaluation to assess possible medical conditions contributing to anger control problems. (4)

## 5. Assess the client’s level of in-

sight (syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others’ concern, and is motivated to work on change;


---

## ANGER CONTROL PROBLEMS  17

demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 6. Assess the client for evidence

of research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with ADHD, depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

## 7. Assess for any issues of age,

gender, or culture that could help explain the client’s currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a better understanding of the client’s behavior.

## 8. Assess for the severity of the

level of impairment to the client’s functioning to determine appropriate level of care (e.g., the behavior noted creates mild, moderate, severe, or very severe impairment in social, relational, vocational, or occupational endeavors); continuously assess this severity of impairment as well as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates severe impairment but the presenting problem now is causing mild or moderate impairment).

5. Cooperate with a medication

evaluation for possible treatment

9. Assess the client for the need and

willingness to take psychotropic


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER18

keeping a daily journal in which he/she documents persons, situations, thoughts, feelings, and actions associated with moments of anger, irritation, or disappointment (or assign “Anger Journal” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma); routinely process the journal toward helping the client understand his/her contributions to generating his/her anger.

## 12. Assist the client in generating a

list of anger triggers; process the list toward helping the client understand the causes and expressions of his/her anger.

## 7. Verbalize increased awareness of

anger expression patterns, their causes, and their consequences. (13, 14, 15, 16)

## 13. Assist the client in re-

conceptualizing anger as involving different dimensions (cognitive, physiological, affective, and behavioral) that interact predictably (e.g., demanding expectations not being met leading to increased arousal and anger leading to acting out) and that can be understood, challenged, and changed.

14. Process the client’s list of anger

triggers and other relevant


---

## ANGER CONTROL PROBLEMS  19

journal information toward helping the client understand how cognitive, physiological, and affective factors interplay to produce anger.

gender, or culture that could help explain the client’s currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a better understanding of the client’s behavior.

12. Assess for the severity of the

level of impairment to the client’s functioning to determine


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER120

appropriate level of care (e.g., the behavior noted creates mild, moderate, severe, or very severe impairment in social, relational, vocational, or occupational endeavors); continuously assess this severity of impairment as well as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates severe impairment but the presenting problem now is causing mild or moderate impairment).

6. Client and/or family describe

their understanding of the assessment results and recommendations. (13, 14)

## 13. Discuss evaluation results with

the client and family members; provide them with education as the nature of the deficits found and treatment options.

## 14. Assess the degree of the client’s

and family’s realistic appraisal of the client’s functioning by inquiring into their perception of the problem areas, the reason for the problems, and the typical clinical course; talk with the client and family about differences between their beliefs and what professionals are saying.

of computerized devices and reinforce use.

10. Use internal or covert cognitive

strategies to increase effective task performance. (20, 21, 22, 23, 24)

## 20. For clients having mild

impairments, demonstrate the use of repetition and enriched imagery (e.g., learning a person’s name by repeating the name of the person during a conversation, and then associating their name with a physical feature (e.g., “Amy” has dark eyebrows that are “aiming” toward her nose).

## 21. For clients having mild

impairments, demonstrate the use of clustering (e.g., organize grocery list items into groups: [4 fruits: bananas, blueberries, lemons, strawberries; 3 dairy items: butter, milk, yogurt; 2 bakery items: bagels, bread); remember these 3 groups, and then items within them, rather than trying to remember 9 random items) thereby focusing attention, enriching images, decreasing the cognitive load, and facilitating retrieval of information.

22. For clients having mild

impairments, teach the peg word


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER122

rhyme (1 is a bun, 2 is a shoe, etc.; see  How to Strengthen Memory by a New Process  by Sambrook) and demonstrate how use of the peg word system coupled with exaggerated imagery, enhances recall of information (e.g., learn cell phone number by developing a mental picture based upon the rhyme. For example, 573-8821 becomes a huge bee hive (5) reaching to heaven (7), with a tree (3) forming a slide down from heaven. Next are two gates (8, 8) behind which are an ornate shoe (2) with a sticky bun (1) inside.

---

## OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)  275

## 30. Teach mindfulness meditation

to help the client recognize the negative thought processes associated with OCD and change his/her relationship with these thoughts by accepting thoughts, images, and impulses that are reality-based while noticing, but not reacting to, non-reality-based mental phenomena (see  Guided Mindfulness Meditation  [Audio CD] by Zabat-Zinn).

task designed to interfere with OCD. (39)

## 39. Develop and assign an Ericksonian

task (see  Ericksonian Approaches by Battino and South) that is consistent with the theme of the client’s obsession or compulsion (i.e., “symptom as task”); process the results with the client. (e.g., if obsessed with a loss, give the client the task to visit, send a card, or bring flowers to someone who has lost someone).

20. Engage in a strategic ordeal to

overcome OCD impulses. (40)

## 40. Create and sell a strategic ordeal

that offers a guaranteed cure to the client for the obsession or compulsion. (Note at the beginning of the therapy that Haley empha- sizes that the “cure” offers an intervention to achieve a goal and is not a promise to cure the client; see Ordeal Therapy  by Haley).

ritual that interrupts the current pattern of compulsions. (41)

## 41. Help the client create and

implement a ritual (e.g., find a job that the client finds necessary but very unpleasant, and have him/her do this job each time he/she finds thoughts becoming obsessive); follow up with the client on the outcome of its implementation and make necessary adjustments.

the treatment of panic or agoraphobia. (4) recommends it (see the Substance Use chapter in this  Planner ).

## 4. Provide behavioral, emotional,

and attitudinal information toward an assessment of specifiers relevant to a  DSM diagnosis, the efficacy of treatment, and the nature of the therapy relationship. (5, 6, 7, 8)

## 5. Assess the client’s level of insight

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others’ concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledg- ment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 6. Assess the client for evidence of

research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with ADHD, depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appro- priate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

## PANIC/AGORAPHOBIA  281

as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates severe impairment but the presenting problem now is causing mild or moderate impairment).

5. Cooperate with an evaluation

by a physician for psychotropic medication. (9)

## 9. Arrange for an evaluation for a

prescription of psychotropic medications to alleviate the client’s symptoms (e.g., serotonergic medication).

and avoidance including cues, level of distress, symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors (or assign “Monitoring My Panic Attack Experiences” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner by Jongsma); use data throughout therapy to support therapeutic interventions (e.g., psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring).

8. Verbalize an accurate

understanding of panic attacks and agoraphobia and their treatment. (12, 13)

## 12. Discuss how panic attacks are

“false alarms” of danger, not medically dangerous, not a sign of weakness or craziness, common but often lead to unnecessary fear and avoidance; correct myths and misconceptions about panic symptoms (e.g., going crazy, dying, losing control) that contribute to fear and avoidance.

## 13. Assign the client to read

psychoeducational chapters of books or treatment manuals on panic disorders and agoraphobia (e.g.,  Mastery of Your Anxiety and


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER282

Panic—Workbook  by Barlow and Craske;  Don’t Panic: Taking Control of Anxiety Attacks  by Wilson;  Living with Fear  by Marks; Thoughts and Feelings: Taking Control of Your Moods and Your Life  by McKay, Davis, and Fanning).

## 14. Discuss how exposure serves as an

arena to desensitize learned fear, build confidence, and feel safer by building a new history of successful experiences.

## 10. Implement calming and coping

strategies to reduce overall anxiety and to cope with the experience of panic. (15, 16, 17)

## 15. Teach the client progressive muscle

relaxation as a daily exercise for general relaxation and train him/her in the use of coping strategies (e.g., staying focused on behavioral goals, muscular relaxation, evenly paced diaphragmatic breathing, positive self-talk) to manage symptom attacks.

## 16. Assign capnometry-assisted

respiratory training (CART) to teach the client, by providing CO 2 level biofeedback, how to gain control over dysfunctional respiratory patterns and associated panic symptoms (e.g., lightheadedness, shortness of breath) through reducing hyperventilation and breathing more slowly and more shallow (see Therapeutic Use of Ambulatory Capnography  by Meuret et al.).

## 17. Teach the client cognitive coping

strategies such as encouraging positive self-talk and/or keeping focused on external stimuli and behavioral responsibilities during panic rather than being preoccupied with internal focus on feared physiological changes.


---

## PANIC/AGORAPHOBIA  283

11. Identify, challenge, and replace

biased, fearful self-talk with reality-based, positive self-talk. (18, 19)

## 18. Explore the client’s schema and

self-talk that mediate his/her fear response, identify and challenge biases; assist him/her in replacing the distorted messages with alternatives that correct for the biases such as overestimating the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes and underestimating one’s ability to cope with panic symptoms.

## 19. Assign the client a homework

exercise in which he/she identifies fearful self-talk and creates reality- based alternatives (or assign “Journal and Replace Self- Defeating Thoughts” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner by Jongsma); test fear-based predictions against alternatives using behavioral experiments; review; reinforce success, problem- solve obstacles toward accomplishing objective (see 10 Simple Solutions to Panic  by Antony and McCabe;  Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic— Workbook  by Barlow and Craske).

## 12. Participate in gradual exposure

to feared physical sensations until they are no longer frightening to experience. (20, 21)

## 20. Teach the client a sensation

exposure technique in which he/she generates feared physical sensations through exercise (e.g., breathes rapidly until slightly lightheaded, spins in chair briefly until slightly dizzy), then records and allows sensations and anxiety associated with them to calm (e.g., using cognitive and/or somatic coping strategies; repeat exercise until anxiety associated with physical sensations wanes (see 10 Simple Solutions to Panic  by Antony and McCabe;  Mastery of


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER284

Your Anxiety and Panic—Therapist Guide  by Craske and Barlow).

## 21. Assign the client a homework

exercise in which he/she does sensation exposures and records (e.g.,  Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic—Workbook  by Barlow and Craske;  10 Simple Solutions to Panic  by Antony and McCabe); review; reinforce success, problem- solve obstacles toward accomplishing objective.

13. Undergo gradual repeated

exposure to feared or avoided situations. (22, 23, 24)

## 22. Direct and assist the client in

construction of a hierarchy of anxiety-producing situations associated with agoraphobia in which a symptom attack and its negative consequences are feared.

## 23. Select initial exposures that have

a high likelihood of being a successful experience for the client; develop a plan for managing the symptoms and rehearse the plan in imagination.

## 24. Assign the client a homework

exercise in which he/she does situational exposures and records responses (e.g., “Gradually Reducing Your Phobic Fear” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma; Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic—Workbook  by Barlow and Craske;  10 Simple Solutions to Panic  by Antony and McCabe); review; reinforce success, problem- solve obstacles toward accomplishing objective.

14. Implement relapse prevention

strategies for managing possible future anxiety symptoms. (25, 26, 27, 28, 29)

## 25. Discuss with the client the

distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with an initial and reversible return of


---

## PANIC/AGORAPHOBIA  285

symptoms, fear, or urges to avoid and relapse with the decision to return to fearful and avoidant patterns.

## 26. Identify and rehearse with the

client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur.

### 27. Instruct the client to routinely use

strategies learned in therapy (e.g., cognitive restructuring, exposure), building them into his/her life as much as possible.

## 28. Develop a “coping card” on which

coping strategies and other important information (e.g., “Pace your breathing,” “Focus on the task at hand,” “You can manage it,” and “It will go away”) are recorded for the client’s later use.

## 29. Schedule a “booster session” for

the client for 1 to 3 months after therapy ends to track progress, reinforce gains, and problem-solve barriers.

15. Participate in Acceptance and

Commitment Therapy (ACT) for panic disorder. (30, 31, 32, 33)

## 30. Use an ACT approach to help the

client accept and openly experience anxious thoughts and feelings without being overly impacted by them, and committing his/her time and efforts to activities that are consistent with identified, personally meaningful values (see  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders  by Eifert, Forsyth, and Hayes).

## 31. Teach mindfulness meditation

to help the client recognize the negative thought processes associated with panic and change his/her relationship with these thoughts by accepting thoughts,


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER286

images, and impulses that are reality-based while noticing, but not reacting to, non-reality-based mental phenomena (see  Guided Mindfulness Meditation  [Audio CD] by Zabat-Zinn).

## 32. Assign the client homework in

which he/she practices lessons from mindfulness meditation and ACT in order to consolidate the approach into everyday life.

### 33. Assign the client reading consistent

with the mindfulness and ACT approach to supplement work done in session (see  The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety by Forsyth and Eifert).

## 16. Work through developmental

conflicts that may be influencing current struggles with fear and avoidance and take appropriate actions. (34)

## 34. Use an insight-oriented approach

client in identifying and expressing feelings related to key unresolved life issues.

## 37. Assess for secondary gains the

client may be receiving by remaining disordered with panic and/or agoraphobia (e.g., attention, care-receiving, avoidance of activity); directly address gains, if evident.


---

## PANIC/AGORAPHOBIA  287

19. Accept or work to resolve

identified life conflicts. (38)

### 38. Explore the resolution of identified

interpersonal or other identified life conflicts; assist the client with acceptance of those that cannot be changed or use a conflict-resolution approach to address those that can.

20. Implement the Ericksonian

task designed to face fear. (39)

## 39. Develop and assign an Ericksonian

task (see  Ericksonian Approaches by Battino and South) that is consistent with the theme of the client’s fears (e.g., the client fears traveling past a certain boundary, so ask him/her to go to it, walk a certain number of steps past it, stop, allow anxiety to come and go, and repeat); process the results with the client

## 21. Commit self to not allowing

the threat of panic symptoms to control decisions in life; take actions based on personal goals rather than fear and avoidance. (40)

## 40. Support the client in following

through with work, family, and social activities rather than escaping or avoiding them to focus on panic symptoms.

## 1. Describe the history and nature

of the phobia(s), complete with impact on functioning and attempts to overcome it. (1, 2)

## 1. Establish rapport with the client

toward building a therapeutic alliance; explore and identify the objects or situations that precipitate the client’s phobic fear.

## 2. Assess the client’s fear and

avoidance, including the focus of the fear, types of avoidance (e.g., distraction, escape, dependence on others), development of the fear, and disability resulting from the fear (consider using  The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Adult Version ).

2. Complete psychological tests

designed to assess features of the phobia. (3)

## 3. Administer a client-report measure

(e.g.,  Measures for Specific Phobia by Antony; the  Fear Survey Schedule-III) to further assess the depth and breadth of phobic responses; readminister as needed to assess treatment outcome.

3. Participate in a behavioral

assessment task. (4)

## 4. Conduct a behavioral assessment

task in which the client is asked to approach, under his/her own direction, the feared object or situation while reporting relevant cognitive and emotional experiences; readminister as needed to assess treatment outcome.

## 4. Disclose any history of

substance use that may contribute to and complicate the treatment of the phobia. (5)

## 5. Arrange for a substance abuse

evaluation and refer the client for treatment for if the evaluation recommends it (see the Substance Use chapter in this  Planner ).

## 6. Assess the client’s level of insight

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others’ concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledg- ment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 7. Assess the client for evidence of

gender, or culture that could help explain the client’s currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a better understanding of the client’s behavior.

## 9. Assess for the severity of the level

of impairment to the client’s functioning to determine appropriate level of care (e.g., the behavior noted creates mild, moderate, severe, or very severe impairment in social, relational, vocational, or occupational endeavors); continuously assess this severity of impairment as well as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates

construction of a hierarchy of anxiety-producing situations associated with the phobic response; include imaginal situations if needed to accommodate excessive fear.

## 26. Select initial exposures that

have a high likelihood of being a successful experience for the client; develop a plan for managing the symptoms and rehearse the plan.

the client 1 to 3 months after therapy ends to reinforce gains and problem-solve any obstacles to progress.

## 14. Learn to accept anxious

thinking and tolerate, rather than avoid, unpleasant emotions while accomplishing meaningful goals. (34, 35, 36)

## 34. Use an Acceptance and Commit-

ment Therapy approach including mindfulness strategies to help the client decrease experiential avoidance, disconnect thoughts from actions, accept one’s experience rather than change or control symptoms, and behave according to his/her broader life values; assist the client in clarifying his/her values and goals and commit to behaving accordingly (see  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders  by Eifert, Forsyth, and Hayes).

35. Recommend that the client read

self-help books consistent with the ACT approach to help supplement

---

## SLEEP DISTURBANCE  377

sleep or sexual activity; get out of bed if sleep doesn’t arrive soon after retiring; lie back down when sleepy; set alarm to the same wake-up time every morning regardless of sleep time or quality; do not nap during the day); assign consistent implementation.

## 19. Instruct the client to move

activities associated with arousal and activation from the bedtime ritual to other times during the day (e.g., reading stimulating content, reviewing day’s events, planning for next day, watching disturbing television).

## 20. Monitor the client’s sleep

patterns and compliance with stimulus control instructions; problem-solve obstacles and reinforce successful, consistent implementation.

11. Learn and implement a sleep

restriction method to increase sleep efficiency. (21)

## 21. Use a sleep restriction therapy

approach in which the amount of time in bed is reduced to match the amount of time the patient typically sleeps (e.g., from 8 hours to 5), thus inducing systematic sleep deprivation; periodically adjust sleep time upward until an optimal sleep duration is reached.

---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER378

(see  Insomnia: A Clinical Guide to Assessment and Treatment  by Morin and Espie).

14. Learn and implement skills for

managing stresses contributing to the sleep problem. (25)

## 25. Use cognitive behavioral skills

training techniques (e.g., instruction, covert modeling [i.e., imagining the successful use of the strategies], role-play, practice, and generalization training) to teach the client tailored skills (e.g., calming and coping skills, conflict-resolution, problem- solving) for managing stressors related to the sleep disturbance (e.g., interpersonal conflicts that carry over and cause nighttime wakefulness); routinely review, reinforce successes, problem-solve obstacles toward effective everyday use (see  Insomnia: A Clinical Guide to Assessment and Treatment by Morin  and Espie; Treating Sleep Disorders  by Goetting, Perlis and Lichstein).


---

## SLEEP DISTURBANCE  379

15. Verbalize an understanding of

the cognitive-behavioral approach to treating sleeplessness. (26)

## 26. Assign the client to read material

on the cognitive-behavioral treatment approach to sleeplessness (e.g.,  Overcoming Insomnia: A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Approach Workbook  by Edinger and Carney;  Say Good Night to Insomnia  by Jacobs).

16. Participate in a scheduled

awakening procedure to reduce the frequency of night wakening. (27)

## 27. Use a scheduled awakening

procedure in which the client is gently and only slightly awakened 30 minutes prior to the typical time of the first night wakening, sleep terror, or sleepwalking incident; phase out the awakening as sleep terrors decrease (see  When Children Don’t Sleep Well  by Durand).

17. Learn and implement relapse

prevention practices. (28, 29, 30, 31, 32)

## 28. Discuss with the client the

29. Identify and rehearse with the

client the management of future lapses.

## 30. Instruct the client to routinely

use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., good sleep hygiene and stimulus control) to prevent relapse into habits associated with sleep disturbance.

## 5. Assess the client’s level of insight

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others’ concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 6. Assess the client for evidence

of research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with ADHD, depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER386

9. Verbalize an understanding of

the rationale for cognitive- behavioral treatment of social anxiety. (14)

11. Identify, challenge, and replace

biased, fearful self-talk with reality-based, positive self-talk. (16, 17)

## 16. Explore the client’s and self-talk

and underlying beliefs that mediate his/her social fears, challenge the biases (or assign “Journal and Replace Self- Defeating Thoughts” in the Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma); assist him/her in generating appraisals that correct for the biases and build confidence.

## 17. Assign the client a homework

exercise in which he/she identifies fearful self-talk and creates reality-based alternatives; test fear-based predictions against alternatives using behavioral experiments; review; reinforce success, problem-solve obstacles toward accomplishing objective (see “Restoring Socialization Comfort” in the  Adult

distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with an initial and reversible return of symptoms, fear, or urges to avoid and relapse with the decision to return to fearful and avoidant patterns.

## 24. Identify and rehearse with the

client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur.

## 25. Instruct the client to routinely

use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., using cognitive restructuring, social skills, and exposure) while building social interactions and relationships.

## SOCIAL ANXIETY  389

efforts to activities that are consistent with identified, personally meaningful values (see  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders  by Eifert, Forsyth, and Hayes).

## 28. Teach mindfulness meditation

to help the client recognize the negative thought processes associated with social anxiety and change his/her relationship with these thoughts by accepting thoughts, images, and impulses that are reality-based while noticing, but not reacting to, non-reality-based mental phenomena (see  Guided Mindfulness Meditation  [Audio CD] by Zabat-Zinn).

## 29. Assign the client homework in

which he/she practices lessons from mindfulness meditation and ACT in order to consolidate the approach into in everyday life.

past and present, and describe the quality, good and poor, of those relationships. (31)

## 31. Conduct Interpersonal Therapy

(apply  Comprehensive Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy  by Weissman, Markowitz, and Klerman) beginning with the assessment of the client’s “interpersonal inventory” of important past and present relationships; develop a case formulation linking social anxiety grief, interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, and/or interpersonal deficits).


---

## THE COMPLETE ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER390

17. Verbalize and demonstrate an

understanding and resolution of current interpersonal problems. (32, 33, 34, 35)

## Appendix C

## RECOVERY MODEL OBJECTIVES AND INTERVENTIONS

The Objectives and Interventions below are created around the 10 core principles developed by a multidisciplinary panel at the 2004 National Consensus Conference on Mental Health Recovery and Mental Health Systems Transformation convened by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2004):

1. Self-direction:  Consumers  lead,  control,  exercise  choice  over,  and

determine  their  own  path  of recovery  by  optimizing  autonomy, independence, and control of resources to achieve a self-determined life. By  definition,  the  recovery  process  must  be  self-directed  by  the individual, who defines his or her own life goals and designs a unique path toward those goals.

2. Individualized and person-centered:  There are multiple pathways to

recovery based on an individual’s unique strengths and resiliencies as well as his or her needs, preferences, experiences (including past trauma), and cultural background in all of its diverse representations. Individuals also identify recovery as being an ongoing journey and an end result as well as an overall paradigm for achieving wellness and optimal mental health.

3. Empowerment:  Consumers have the authority to choose from a range of

options and to participate in all decisions—including the allocation of resources—that will affect their lives, and are educated and supported in so doing.  They  have  the  ability  to join  with  other  consumers  to collectively  and  effectively  speak  for  themselves  about  their  needs, wants, desires, and aspirations. Through empowerment, an individual


---

## RECOVERY MODEL OBJECTIVES AND INTERVENTIONS  571

gains control of his or her own destiny and influences the organizational and societal structures in his or her life.

4. Holistic:  Recovery encompasses an individual’s whole life, including

mind, body, spirit, and community. Recovery embraces all aspects of life,  including  housing,  employment,  education,  mental  health  and healthcare  treatment  and  services,  complementary  and  naturalistic services, addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation, and family supports as determined by the person. Families, providers, organizations, systems, communities, and society  play  crucial  roles  in creating  and  maintaining  meaningful opportunities for consumer access to these supports.

5. Nonlinear:  Recovery is not a step-by-step process but one based on

continual growth, occasional setbacks, and learning from experience. Recovery begins with an initial stage of awareness in which a person recognizes that positive change is possible. This awareness enables the consumer to move on to fully engage in the work of recovery.

6. Strengths-based:  Recovery  focuses  on  valuing  and  building  on  the

multiple capacities, resiliencies, talents, coping abilities, and inherent worth of individuals. By building on these strengths, consumers leave stymied life roles behind and engage in new life roles (e.g., partner, caregiver, friend, student, employee). The process of recovery moves forward  through  interaction  with  others  in supportive,  trust-based relationships.

7. Peer support:  Mutual support—including the sharing of experiential

knowledge and skills and social learning—plays an invaluable role in recovery. Consumers encourage and engage other consumers in recovery and  provide  each  other  with  a sense  of belonging,  supportive relationships, valued roles, and community.

8. Respect:  Community, systems, and societal acceptance and appreciation

of consumers—including  protecting  their  rights  and  eliminating discrimination  and  stigma—are  crucial  in achieving  recovery.  Self- acceptance  and  regaining  belief  in one’s  self  are  particularly  vital. Respect ensures the inclusion and full participation of consumers in all aspects of their lives.

9. Responsibility:  Consumers have a personal responsibility for their own

self-care and journeys of recovery. Taking steps toward their goals may require great courage. Consumers must strive to understand and give meaning to their experiences and identify coping strategies and healing processes to promote their own wellness.

10. Hope:  Recovery provides the essential and motivating message of a

better future—that people can overcome the barriers and obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized, but can be fostered by peers, families, friends, providers, and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. Mental health recovery not only benefits individuals with mental health disabilities by focusing on their abilities to live, work, learn, and fully participate in our society, but also enriches the texture of American  community  life.  America  reaps  the  benefits  of the contributions individuals with mental disabilities can make, ultimately becoming a stronger and healthier Nation. 1

The numbers used for Objectives in the treatment plan below correspond to the numbers above for the core principles. Each of the 10 Objectives was written to capture the essential theme of the like-numbered core principle. The numbers in parentheses after the Objectives denote the Interventions designed to assist the client in attaining each respective Objective. The clinician may select any or all of the Objectives and Intervention statements to include in the client’s treatment plan.

One generic Long-Term Goal statement is offered should the clinician desire to emphasize a recovery model orientation in the client’s treatment plan.
