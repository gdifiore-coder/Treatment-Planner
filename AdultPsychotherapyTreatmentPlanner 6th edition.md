## PRACTICEPLANNERS ® SERIES PREFACE

Accountability is an important dimension of the practice of psychotherapy. Treatment programs, public agencies, clinics, and practitioners must justify and document their treatment plans to outside review entities in order to be reimbursed for services. The books in the PracticePlanners ® series are designed to help practitioners fulfill these documentation requirements efficiently and professionally.

The Practice Planners ® series includes a wide array of treatment planning books including not only the original  Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner , Child Psychotherapy Treatment Planner , Adolescent Psychotherapy Treatment Planner , and Addictions Treatment Planner  all now in their sixth editions, but also Treatment Planners targeted to specialty areas of practice, including:

## Co-occurring disorders

## Integrated behavioral medicine

## College students

## Couples therapy

## Crisis counseling

## Early childhood education

## Employee assistance

## Family therapy

## Gays and lesbians

## Group therapy

## Juvenile justice and residential care

### Intellectual and developmental disability

## Neuro rehabilitation

## Older adults


---

## Parenting skills

## Pastoral counseling

## Personality disorders

## Probation and parole

Psychopharmacology

### School counseling and school social work

## Severe and persistent mental illness

## Sexual abuse victims and offenders

## Social work and human services

## Special education

## Speech-language pathology

## Suicide and homicide risk assessment

## Veterans and active military duty

## Women's issues

In addition, there are three branches of companion books that can be used in conjunction with the  Treatment Planners , or on their own:

Progress Notes Planners  provide a menu of progress statements that elaborate on the client's symptom presentation and the provider's therapeutic intervention. Each  Progress Notes Planner statement is directly integrated with the behavioral definitions and therapeutic interventions from its companion  Treatment Planner .

Homework Planners  include homework assignments designed around each presenting problem (such as anxiety, depression, chemical dependence, anger management, eating disorders, or panic disorder) that is the focus of a chapter in its corresponding Treatment Planner .

Client Education Handout Planners  provide brochures and handouts to help educate and inform clients on presenting problems and mental health issues, as well as life skills techniques. The handouts are included on CD-ROMs for easy printing from your computer and are ideal for use in waiting rooms, at presentations, as


---

newsletters, or as information for clients struggling with mental illness issues. The topics covered by these handouts correspond to the presenting problems in the  Treatment Planners .

### The Series also includes:

Evidence-Based Psychotherapy Treatment Planning Video Series  offers 12 sixty-minute programs that provide step-by-step guidance on how to use empirically supported treatments to inform the entire treatment planning process. In a viewer friendly manner, Drs. Art Jongsma and Tim Bruce discuss the steps involved in integrating evidence-based treatment (EBT) Objectives and Interventions into a treatment plan. The research support for the EBTs is summarized, and selected aspects of the EBTs are demonstrated in role-played counseling scenarios.

### A companion Treatment Planning software product is also available:

TheraScribe ® , the #1 selling treatment planning and clinical record-keeping software system for mental health professionals. TheraScribe ® allows the user to import the data from any of the Treatment Planner, Progress Notes Planner, or Homework Planner books into the software's expandable database to simply point and click to create a detailed, organized, individualized, and customizable treatment plan along with optional integrated progress notes and homework assignments. TheraScribe is available by calling 616-776-

### 1745. Also, see TheraScribe.com for more information.

The goal of our series is to provide practitioners with the resources they need in order to provide high-quality care in the era of accountability. To put it simply: We seek to help you spend more time on patients and less time on paperwork.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Since 2005 we have turned to research evidence to inform the treatment Objectives and Interventions in our latest editions of the  Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  books. Although much of the content of our  Planners was “best practice” and also from the mainstream of sound psychological procedure, we have benefited significantly from a thorough review that looked through the lens of evidence-based practice. The later editions of the  Planners  now stand as content not based just on “best practice” but on reliable research results. Although several of my coauthors have contributed to this recertification of our content, Timothy J. Bruce has been the main guiding force behind this effort. Dr. Bruce has used his depth of knowledge regarding evidence-supported treatment to shape and inform the content of the last three editions of  Adult, Adolescent, Child,  and  Addiction Psychotherapy Treatment Planners .

I am pleased to announce that after the current revisions of these planners, Dr. Bruce will be assuming the role of Series Editor as I move toward retirement. I make this move with the utmost confidence that the PracticePlanners  series will be in very capable hands. Tim is the consummate psychologist who knows the research literature on psychotherapy, is a compassionate and effective therapist, and whose integrity and ethics are of the highest caliber. I am always thankful for Tim Bruce and his many gifts.

It has now been 25 years since my first Treatment Planner book was published by Wiley. The series has grown to 53 books and my relationship with the highly regarded John Wiley & Sons publishing house continues to be strong. In a day of pervasive quickly fading loyalties I count it a blessing for us to be trusted partners for all these years. Thank you to my current editor Darren along with Veronika and Monica for your great professionalism.

I also tip my hat to my coauthor, Mark Peterson, who launched this Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  with me by adding his original content contributions many years ago and has supported all the efforts to keep it fresh and evidence based.

Finally, every ship needs a strong rudder to stay on course. My rudder for

all the vagaries of life is my wife, Judy, and we both keep seeking God's will as our ultimate map.

I am more than fortunate to have been invited some 15 years ago by Dr. Art Jongsma to work with him on his well-known and highly regarded PracticePlanners  series and to have been welcomed by his coauthors with whom I have had the pleasure of working, including our coauthor on this volume, Mark Peterson. As a reader of this book, you probably appreciate that Dr. Jongsma's treatment planners are works of enormous value to practicing clinicians as well as terrific educational tools for “students” of our profession. I remember reading my first treatment planner and thinking, “Wow! Art has done something here, and done it very well!” Since then, I have come to know Art, his family, his friends, his thoughts, his values, his love of my paella, the way he lives his life, and I can tell you that my first impression was correct. As a psychologist, husband, father, colleague, you name it, Art Jongsma has done something here and done it very well. I am more than fortunate to have him as a colleague and friend. As Art noted in his acknowledgment, he recently told me of his plans to “move toward” retirement and asked me if I would take stewardship of, take care of, his brainchild and invaluable contribution to our field. To say the least, I was honored, but also simultaneously humbled. By this, I mean that I am no Art Jongsma, but I will do my best to keep this series of the quality and value that he has. Thank you again, Art, for everything.

I would also like to thank the team at John Wiley & Sons. Executive Editor Darren Lalonde, Senior Project Editor Daniel Finch, Senior Manager Veronika Yefremenko, and their staff who were expert, kind, supportive, and professional in managing what I think we should call a highly effective international coordination of the writing and publishing process. It was a pleasure.

Lastly, I would like to thank my wife of 39 years, Lori, our son Logan, daughter-in-law Cassy, and daughter Madeline, for all they do. I am more than fortunate. Thank you.

## ABOUT PRACTICE PLANNERS ® TREATMENT PLANNERS

Pressure from third-party payers, accrediting agencies, and other outside parties has increased the need for clinicians to quickly produce effective, high-quality treatment plans.  Treatment Planners  provide all the elements necessary to quickly and easily develop formal treatment plans that satisfy the needs of most third-party payers and state and federal review agencies.

### Each  Treatment Planner:

Saves you hours of time-consuming paperwork.

### Offers the freedom to develop customized treatment plans.

Includes over 1,000 clear statements describing the behavioral manifestations of each relational problem and provides long-term goals, short-term objectives, and clinically tested treatment options.

Has an easy-to-use reference format that helps locate treatment plan components by behavioral problem or  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition  (DSM-5™) diagnosis.

As with the rest of the books in the Practice Planners ® series, our aim is to clarify, simplify, and accelerate the treatment planning process, so you spend less time on paperwork and more time with your clients.

**ABOUT THIS SIXTH EDITION COMPLETE  ADULT PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNER**

This Sixth Edition of the  Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  has been improved in many ways:

Updated with new and revised evidence-based Objectives and Interventions from the research literature

Revised, expanded, and updated References to Clinical Resources for Evidence-Based Chapters appendix

Moved a Revised Appendix for References to Empirical Support online as found at: www.wiley.com/go/jongsma/adulttp6e

More suggested homework assignments integrated into the Interventions

Expanded and updated self-help book list in the Bibliotherapy appendix

Addition of new chapters on Loneliness and on Opioid Use Disorder

Unipolar Depression chapter has been renamed Depression— Unipolar and Sexual Identity Confusion chapter has been renamed Sexual Orientation Confusion

Suicidal Ideation has been added to the list of evidence-based chapters with new research content inserted

Integrated  DSM-5  diagnostic labels and codes into the Diagnostic Suggestions section of each chapter and all transition references to DSM-IV  have been removed

Evidence-based practice (EBP) is steadily becoming the standard of care in mental health care as it has in medical health care. Professional organizations such as the American Psychological Association, National Association of Social Workers, and the American Psychiatric Association, as well as consumer organizations such the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) have all endorsed the use of EBP. In some practice settings, EBP is becoming mandated. Some third-party payers are requiring use of EBP for reimbursement. It is clear that the call for evidence and accountability is being increasingly sounded. So, what is


---

### EBP and how is its use facilitated by this  Planner ?

Borrowing from the Institute of Medicine's definition (Institute of Medicine, 2001), the American Psychological Association (APA) has defined EBP as “the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences” (APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, 2006). Consistent with this definition, we have identified those psychological treatments with the best available supporting evidence, added Objectives and Interventions consistent with them in the pertinent chapters, and identified these with this symbol:  . As most practitioners know, research has shown that although these treatment methods may have demonstrated efficacy, factors such as the individual psychologist (e.g., Wampold, 2001), the treatment relationship (e.g., Norcross, 2019), and the client (e.g., Bohart & Tallman, 1999) are also vital contributors to optimizing a client's response to psychotherapy. As noted by the APA, “Comprehensive evidence-based practice will consider all of these determinants and their optimal combinations.” (APA, 2006, p. 275). For more information and instruction on constructing evidence-based psychotherapy treatment plans, see our 12 DVD-based training videos titled  Evidence-Based Psychotherapy Treatment Planning  (Jongsma & Bruce, 2010–2012).

The sources we used to identify the evidence-based treatments integrated into this  Planner  are multiple and, we believe, high quality. They include rigorous meta-analyses, current critical, expert reviews, as well as evidence-based practice guideline recommendations. Examples of specific sources include the Cochrane Collaboration reviews; the work of the Society of Clinical Psychology identifying research-supported psychological treatments; evidence-based treatment reviews (e.g., David, Lynn, & Montgomery, 2018; Nathan & Gorman, 2015), as well as critical analyses of the process through which evidence-based practice is defined (e.g., Dimidjian, 2019; Norcross, Hogan, Koocher, & Maggio, 2017). Evidence-based practice guidelines informing the selection process include those from the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to name a few.

Although sources may vary slightly in the criteria they use for judging


---

levels of empirical support, we favored those that use more rigorous criteria, typically requiring demonstration of efficacy through randomized controlled trials or clinical replication series, good experimental methodology, and independent replication. Our approach was to evaluate these various sources and include those treatments supported by the highest level of evidence and for which there was consensus across most of these sources. For any chapter in which EBP is indicated, references to the sources used to identify them can be found online at www.wiley.com/go/jongsma/adulttp6e. In addition to these references to empirical support, we have also included a References to Clinical Resources appendix. Clinical resources are books, manuals, and other resources for clinicians that describe the details of the application, or the “how to,” of the treatment approaches described in a chapter.

We recognize that there is debate regarding evidence-based practice among mental health professionals, who are not always in agreement regarding the best treatment, what factors contribute to good outcomes, or even what constitutes “evidence.” We also recognize that some practitioners are skeptical about changing their practice based on psychotherapy research. Our intent in this book is to accommodate these differences by providing a range of treatment plan options, including those consistent with the “best available research” (APA, 2006), those reflecting common clinical practices of experienced clinicians (that may not have been subjected to study), and some that reflect promising emerging approaches. Our intent is to allow users of this planner an array of options so they can construct what they believe to be the best plan for their particular client.

More recently, psychotherapy research is moving toward trying to identify evidence-based principles of psychotherapeutic change that cut across the various individual psychotherapies that have largely been the focus of outcome research. An example of this call is seen in Goldfried (2019), in which he advances the following principles:

Promoting client expectation and motivation that therapy can help

### Establishing an optimal therapeutic alliance

Facilitating client awareness of the factors associated with his or her difficulties

Encouraging the client to engage in corrective experiences


---

### Emphasizing ongoing reality testing in the client's life

Although many endorse this effort, at the time of this writing it is still in progress. Consequently, our approach to identifying objectives and interventions consistent with evidence-based practices reflects what has been done from the “principles” approach as well as the research demonstrating the efficacy and effectiveness of individual models. Perhaps the field will advance enough by the next edition of this planner to include only evidence-based principles of psychotherapeutic change. Until then, we believe that the approach we have taken reflects the current state of the science.

Each of the chapters in this edition provides options to integrate homework exercises into the Interventions. Many (but not all) of the client homework exercise suggestions were taken from and can be found in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  (Jongsma, 2013). You will find more homework assignments suggested in this sixth edition of the  Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  than in previous editions.

The Bibliotherapy Suggestions appendix of this  Planner  has been expanded and updated from previous editions. It includes classics, recently published offerings, as well as more recent editions of books cited in our earlier editions. All the self-help books and client workbooks cited in the chapter Interventions are listed in this appendix. There are also many additional books listed that are supportive of the treatment approaches described in the respective chapters. Each chapter has a list of self-help books consistent with the chapter's content listed in this appendix.

In its final report titled  Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America,  The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health called for recovery to be the “common, recognized outcome of mental health services” (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). To define recovery, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Interagency Committee on Disability Research in partnership with six other Federal agencies convened the National Consensus Conference on Mental Health Recovery and Mental Health Systems Transformation (SAMHSA, 2004). Over 110 expert panelists participated including mental health consumers, family members, providers, advocates, researchers,


---

academicians, managed care representatives, accreditation bodies, state and local public officials, and others. From these deliberations, the following consensus statement was derived:

Mental health recovery is a journey of healing and transformation for a person with a mental health problem to be able to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve maximum human potential. Recovery is a multi-faceted concept based on the following 10 fundamental elements and guiding principles:

Self-direction

## Individualized and person-centered

Empowerment

Holistic

Nonlinear

Strengths-based

## Peer support

Respect

Responsibility

## Hope (SAMHSA, 2004, p. 13)

These principles are defined in Appendix C. We have also created a set of Goal, Objective, and Intervention statements that reflect these 10 principles. The clinician who desires to insert into the client treatment plan specific statements reflecting a Recovery Model orientation may choose from this list.

In addition to this list, we believe that many of the Goal, Objective, and Intervention statements found in the chapters reflect a recovery orientation. For example, our assessment interventions are meant to identify how the problem affects this unique client and the strengths that the client brings to the treatment. Additionally, an intervention statement such as, “Assist the client in finding positive, hopeful things in his/hertheir life at the present time” from the Suicidal Ideation chapter is evidence that recovery model content permeates items listed throughout our chapters. However, if the clinician desires a more focused set of statements directly related to each principle guiding the recovery model,


---

## they can be found in Appendix C.

We have done a bit of reorganizing of chapter content for this edition. We have renamed the Unipolar Depression chapter as Depression—Unipolar. This chapter continues to be distinct from the chapter written for Bipolar Disorder—Depression. Bipolar Disorder—Mania continues to be a companion to the Bipolar Disorder—Depression chapter. You will note that some of the content from the Bipolar Disorder—Depression chapter is repeated in the Bipolar Disorder—Mania chapter, but that the evidence-based treatment (EBT) symbol may or may not be present for the same content. This is done to indicate that the particular EBT currently has support for its efficacy on that particular chapter's problem (e.g., symptoms of mania) but not necessarily on other aspects of the disorder (e.g., symptoms of bipolar depression). If more information is desired regarding the specific effects of any evidence-based treatment, one can find them by consulting the references to empirical support for that chapter online at www.wiley.com/go/jongsma/adulttp6e.

In regard to new presenting problems to add to this  Planner, we debated whether we should add a chapter on Opioid Use Disorder because it is a continuing national addiction problem of major proportions. We decided that, although the chapter on Substance Use contains content that is directly applicable to opioid use treatment, there is enough content unique to Opioid Use treatment to call for the addition of this new chapter. We borrowed some content from the Opioid Dependence chapter found in  The Veterans and Active Duty Military Psychotherapy Treatment Planner  by Moore and Jongsma (2015) and updated it with more recent treatment research results. The other new chapter for this edition focuses on Loneliness as a primary presenting problem. Interventions deal with social anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, grief, developmental communication issues, and personality disorder factors. Despite our current culture's preoccupation with “social media,” hosts of people feel isolated and afraid to or do not know how to “reach out and touch someone.” We hope this chapter will help clinicians effectively treat clients with this problem.

Lastly, some clinicians have asked that the Objective statements in this Planner  be written such that the client's attainment of the Objective can be measured. We have written our objectives in behavioral terms and many are measurable as written. For example, this Objective from the


---

Anxiety chapter is one that is measurable as written because it either can be done or it cannot: “Verbalize an understanding of the role that cognitive biases play in excessive irrational worry and persistent anxiety symptoms.” But at times the statements are too broad to be considered measurable. Consider, for example, this Objective from the Anxiety chapter: “Identify, challenge, and replace biased, fearful self-talk with positive, realistic, and empowering self-talk.” To make it quantifiable a clinician might modify it to read, “Give two examples of identifying, challenging, and replacing biased, fearful self-talk with positive, realistic, and empowering self-talk.” Clearly, the use of two examples is arbitrary, but it does allow for a quantifiable measurement of the attainment of the Objective. Similarly, consider this example from the Anxiety chapter: “Identify and engage in pleasant activities on a daily basis.” To make it more measurable the clinician might simply add a desired target number of pleasant activities, thus: “Identify and report engagement in two pleasant activities on a daily basis.” The exact target number that the client is to attain is subjective and should be selected by the individual clinician in consultation with the client. Once the exact target number is determined, then our content can be very easily modified to fit the specific treatment situation. For more information on psychotherapy treatment plan writing, see Jongsma (2005).

We hope you find these improvements to this sixth edition of the  Adult Treatment Planner  useful to your treatment planning needs.

## HOW TO USE THIS TREATMENT PLANNER

Use this  Treatment Planner  to write treatment plans according to the following progression of six steps:

1. Problem Selection.  Although the client may discuss a variety of

issues during the assessment, the clinician must determine the most significant problems on which to focus the treatment process. Usually a primary problem will surface, and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other problems may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can deal with only a few selected problems or treatment will lose its direction. Choose the problem within this Planner  that most accurately represents your client's presenting issues.

2. Problem Definition.  Each client presents with unique nuances as

to how a problem behaviorally reveals itself in his or her life. Therefore, each problem that is selected for treatment focus requires a specific definition about how it is evidenced in the particular client. The symptom pattern should be associated with diagnostic criteria and codes such as those found in the  DSM-5  or the International Classification of Diseases. This  Planner  offers such behaviorally specific definition statements to choose from or to serve as a model for your own personally crafted statements.

3. Goal Development.  The next step in developing your treatment

plan is to set broad goals for the resolution of the target problem. These statements need not be crafted in measurable terms but can be global, long-term goals that indicate a desired positive outcome to the treatment procedures. This  Planner  provides several possible goal statements for each problem, but one statement is all that is required in a treatment plan.

4. Objective Construction.  In contrast to long-term goals, objectives

must be stated in behaviorally measurable language so that it is clear to review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed care organizations when the client has achieved the established objectives. The objectives presented in this  Planner  are designed to meet this demand for accountability. Numerous alternatives are


---

presented to allow construction of a variety of treatment plan possibilities for the same presenting problem.

5. Intervention Creation.  Interventions are the actions of the

clinician designed to help the client complete the objectives. There should be at least one intervention for every objective. If the client does not accomplish the objective after the initial intervention, new interventions should be added to the plan. Interventions should be selected on the basis of the client's needs and strengths and the treatment provider's full therapeutic repertoire. This  Planner contains interventions from a broad range of therapeutic approaches, and we encourage providers to write other interventions reflecting their own training and experience.

Some suggested interventions listed in the  Planner  refer to specific books that can be assigned to the client for adjunctive bibliotherapy. Appendix A contains a full bibliographic reference list of these materials, including these two popular choices:  Read Two Books and Let's Talk Next Week: Using Bibliotherapy in Clinical Practice by Joshua and DiMenna and  Rent Two Films and Let's Talk in the Morning: Using Popular Movies in Psychotherapy, Second Edition by Hesley and Hesley (both books are published by Wiley). For further information about self-help books, mental health professionals may wish to consult  Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, Revised Edition  (Norcross et al., 2003).

6. Diagnosis Determination.  The determination of an appropriate

diagnosis is based on an evaluation of the client's complete clinical presentation. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal symptoms that the client presents with the criteria for diagnosis of a mental illness condition as described in DSM-5. Despite arguments made against diagnosing clients in this manner, diagnosis is a reality that exists in the world of mental health care, and it is a necessity for third-party reimbursement. It is the clinician's thorough knowledge of  DSM-5  criteria and a complete understanding of the client assessment data that contribute to the most reliable, valid diagnosis.

Congratulations! After completing these six steps, you should have a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan ready for immediate


---

implementation and presentation to the client. A sample treatment plan for Anxiety is provided at the end of this introduction.


---

## A FINAL NOTE ON TAILORING THE TREATMENT PLAN TO THE CLIENT

One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client's problems and needs. Treatment plans should not be mass-produced, even if clients have similar problems. The individual's strengths and weaknesses, unique stressors, social network, family circumstances, and symptom patterns must be considered in developing a treatment strategy. Drawing upon our own years of clinical experience and the best available research, we have put together a variety of treatment choices. These statements can be combined in thousands of permutations to develop detailed treatment plans. Relying on their own good judgment, clinicians can easily select the statements that are appropriate for the individuals whom they are treating. In addition, we encourage readers to add their own definitions, goals, objectives, and interventions to the existing samples. As with all of the books in the  Treatment Planner  series, it is our hope that this book will help promote effective, creative treatment planning—a process that will ultimately benefit the client, clinician, and mental health community.

or culture that could help explain the client's currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a better understanding of the client's behavior.

### 9. Assess for the severity of the level of

impairment to the client's functioning to determine appropriate level of care (e.g., the behavior noted creates mild, moderate, severe, or very severe impairment in social, relational, vocational, or occupational endeavors); continuously assess this severity of impairment as well as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates severe impairment but the presenting problem now is causing mild or moderate impairment).

## 6. Explore the

consequences of anger, motivation, and willingness to participate in treatment, and agree to

the client recognize the negative thought processes associated with anger and change his/her/their relationship with these thoughts by accepting thoughts, images, and impulses that are reality-based while noticing but not reacting to non- reality-based mental phenomena (see Guided Mindfulness Meditation [Audio CD Series] by Kabat-Zinn)

25. Gain insight into

the origins of current anger

47. Assist the client in identifying past

relationship dynamics (e.g., with father, mother, others) that may have

current stage of change and willingness to take action steps toward change (see  Motivational Interviewing  by Miller and Rollnick).

19. Utilize a

paradoxical intervention technique to reduce the anxiety response. (41)

## 41. Develop a paradoxical intervention

(see  Ordeal Therapy  by Haley) in which the client is encouraged to have the problem (e.g., anxiety) and then schedule that anxiety to occur at specific intervals each day (at a time of day/night when the client would be clearly wanting to do something else) in a specific way and for a defined length of time.

20. Complete a

cost-benefit analysis of maintaining the anxiety. (42)

### 42. Ask the client to evaluate the costs and

benefits of worries (e.g., complete the Cost Benefit Analysis exercise in  Ten Days to Self-Esteem!  by Burns) in which the client lists the advantages and disadvantages of the negative thought, fear, or anxiety; process the completed assignment.

---

Adult ADHD: Therapist Manual  by Safren et al.).

### 23. Assign the client readings consistent

with the treatment model to increase knowledge of ADHD and its treatment (e.g.,  Mastering Your Adult ADHD: Client Workbook  by Safren et al;  The New Attention Deficit Disorder in Adults Workbook  by Weiss).

approach that examines the client's “thinking about his/her/their thinking” (i.e., the meaning the client places on vulnerabilities associated with ADHD and his/her/their thoughts about how to respond to them accordingly) toward developing a more adaptive plan based on a new, less threatening metacognitive appraisals (see  Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and


---

Depression  by Wells).

problem-solving skills to planning as a first step in overcoming procrastination; for each plan, break it down into manageable time- limited steps to reduce the influence of distractibility.

## 38. Teach the client to apply new

cognitive restructuring skills to challenge thoughts that encourage the use of procrastination (e.g., “I can do this later” or “I'll finish this after I watch my TV show”) and embrace thoughts encouraging action.

## 39. Assign homework asking the client

to accomplish identified tasks without procrastination using the techniques learned in therapy (or supplement with “Self- Monitoring/Self-Reward Program”


---

in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma); review and provide corrective feedback toward improving the skill and decreasing procrastination.

## 19. Combine

skills learned in therapy into a new daily approach to managing ADHD. (40, 41, 42)

## 40. Teach the client meditational and

self-control strategies (e.g., “stop, look, listen, and think”) to delay the need for instant gratification and inhibit impulses to achieve more meaningful, longer-term goals.

### 41. Select situations in which the client

will be increasingly challenged to apply new strategies for managing ADHD, starting with situations highly likely to be successful.

## 42. Use any of several techniques,

including imagery, behavioral rehearsal, modeling, role-playing, or in vivo exposure/behavioral experiments to help the client consolidate the use of new ADHD management skills.

## 17. Using commitment strategies and

motivational interviewing, solicit from the client an agreement to work collaboratively within the parameters of the DBT approach including staying in therapy for the specified time period, attending scheduled therapy sessions, reducing self-harm and suicidal behaviors, and participating in skills training to address the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive vulnerabilities targeted in treatment.

8. Verbalize  18. Gather a thorough history of the client's


---

any history of self-harm and suicidal urges and behavior. (18, 19, 20, 21, 22)

self-harm and suicidal behaviors.

onset, frequency, triggers, seriousness/risk, means, access to means, intent, and immediate consequences that may reward or maintain the self-harm behaviors (i.e., their function).

## 20. Arrange for hospitalization, as

necessary, when the client is determined to be at high risk of life- threatening self-harm.

### 21. Assign self-monitoring forms (e.g., DBT

Diary Cards) to be reviewed weekly at the start of each session to quickly assess self-harm risk and determine if further assessment is required (recognizing that some level of suicidal ideation and urges may be chronically present and need not be assessed or discussed at every session).

22. Provide the client with an emergency

---

Jongsma).

## 13.

Participate in a group (preferably) or individual skills- training course. (29, 30)

## 29. Conduct group or individual skills

training tailored to the client's personal vulnerabilities and skill deficits including analyzing one's behavior, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills (see  DBT Skills Training Manual  by Linehan.

14. Discuss

previous or current posttraumatic stress. (31)

### 31. After adaptive behavioral patterns and

emotional regulation skills are evident, work with the client on posttraumatic sequelae, reducing avoidance or denial, increasing insight into its effects, reducing maladaptive emotional and/or behavioral responses to trauma-related stimuli, reducing self-blame, increasing acceptance and tolerance toward facilitating posttraumatic growth.

15. Identify,

challenge, and replace biased, fearful self- talk with

### 32. Explore the client's self-talk, underlying

assumptions, and schema that mediate trauma-related and other fears; identify and challenge biases; assist the client in generating thoughts that correct for the

### 38. Assist the client in reframing thoughts

about his/her/their life as one that has many positive elements outside of the pain; ask the client to list positive aspects of himself/herself/themselves as well as life circumstances (or supplement with “Positive Self-Talk” and/or “What's Good about Me and My Life?” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma).

## 22. Integrate

and implement all new mental, somatic, and behavioral strategies for managing pain. (39)

### 39. Assist the client in integrating his/her

pain management skills learned in therapy (e.g., calming, cognitive coping, distraction, activity scheduling, problem-solving); transition use from therapy sessions to daily life as mastery becomes evident; review, reinforcing success and problem-solving obstacles toward sustained and effective integration into daily life (see Psychological Approaches to Pain Management  by Turk and Gatchel).

## 23.

Implement relapse prevention strategies for managing future challenges. (40, 41, 42)

### 40. Discuss with the client the distinction

between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with an initial and reversible return of pain or old habits (e.g., a “bad day”) and relapse with the persistent return of pain and previous cognitive and behavioral habits that exacerbate pain.

41. Identify and rehearse with the client the

management of future situations or


---

circumstances in which lapses could occur, using the strategies learned during therapy to manage them.

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others' concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

12. Assess the client for evidence of


---

research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

computerized devices and reinforce use.

## 11. Use internal

or covert cognitive strategies to increase effective task performance. (22, 23, 24, 25, 26)

## 22. For clients having mild

impairments, demonstrate the use of repetition and enriched imagery (e.g., learning a person's name by repeating the name of the person during a conversation, and then associating the name with a physical feature, e.g., “Amy” has dark eyebrows that are “aiming” toward her nose).

## 23. For clients having mild

impairments, demonstrate the use of clustering (e.g., organize grocery list items into groups: [4 fruits: bananas, blueberries, lemons, strawberries; 3 dairy items: butter, milk, yogurt; 2 bakery items: bagels, bread]; remember these 3 groups, and then items within them, rather than trying to remember 9 random items) thereby focusing attention, enriching images, decreasing the cognitive load, and facilitating retrieval of information.

24. For clients having mild

impairments, teach the peg word


---

rhyme (1 is a bun, 2 is a shoe, etc.; see  How to Strengthen Memory by a New Process  by Sambrook) and demonstrate how use of the peg word system coupled with exaggerated imagery enhances recall of information (e.g., learn cell phone number by developing a mental picture based upon the rhyme. For example, 573-8821 becomes a huge beehive (5) reaching to heaven (7), with a tree (3) forming a slide down from heaven. Next are two gates (8, 8) behind which are an ornate shoe (2) with a sticky bun (1) inside.

## 25. Recommend the client cue self

silently (e.g., “Focus,” “Stay on task”) to maintain concentration and facilitate persistence.

implement environmental changes to enhance everyday performance. (29)

## 29. Discuss ways to modify the client's

environment (e.g., reduce clutter, reduce distractions, maintain consistent placement of regularly used items, label locations of commonly used objects, identify one purse/wallet that the client will consistently use) to enhance functioning.

15. Participate in

cognitive rehabilitation sessions and perform homework exercises. (30)

30. Refer the client for cognitive

of the therapy relationship. (8, 9, 10, 11)

## 9. Assess the client for evidence of

research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

## 44. Conduct a comprehensive behavioral

weight loss intervention with the client (e.g.,  The LEARN Program for Weight Management  by Brownell;  Cognitive- Behavioral Treatment of Obesity  by Cooper et al.;  The Look AHEAD Program  by the Look AHEAD Research Group) that intervenes in key areas involved in losing and maintaining weight loss (e.g., active lifestyle; increased exercise; balanced nutrition; optimal total caloric intake; trigger identification, removal, and management; cognitive restructuring; personal and interpersonal skill building).

### 45. In weekly sessions, systematically work

through the behavioral weight loss program teaching each component, reinforcing gains, problem-solving obstacles toward sustaining implementation.


---

## 25. Verbalize

an understanding of relapse prevention and the distinction between a lapse and a relapse. (46, 47)

### 46. Discuss with the client the distinction

between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with an initial and reversible return of distress, urges, or to avoid, and relapse with the decision to return to the cycle of maladaptive thoughts and actions (e.g., feeling anxious, binging, then purging).

DSM diagnosis, the efficacy of treatment, and the nature of the therapy relationship. (8, 9, 10, 11)

concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 9. Assess the client for evidence of

## 9. Verbalize

an accurate understanding of OCD or related disorder, how it develops, and how it is maintained. (15)

### 15. Convey a biopsychosocial model for the

development and maintenance of OCD or related disorder highlighting the role of unwarranted fear and avoidance in its maintenance (see  Understanding and Treating Obsessive Cumpulsive Disorder  by Abramowitz).

10. Verbalize

an understanding of the treatment rationale for OCD. (16, 17)

### 16. Provide a rationale for treatment to the

client, discussing how treatment serves as an arena to desensitize learned fear, reality-test obsessional fears and underlying beliefs, and build confidence in a new nonavoidant approach to obsessions and compulsions (see Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for OCD by Bream et al.).


---

## 17. Assign the client to read

psychoeducational chapters of books or treatment manuals or consult other recommended sources for information on the rationale for exposure and ritual prevention therapy and/or cognitive restructuring for OCD (e.g.,  Getting Over OCD  by Abramowitz;  The OCD Workbook  by Hyman and Pedrick;  The BDD Workbook  by Claiborn and Pedrick;  Treatment for Hoarding:

Workbook  by Steketee and Frost).

11. Identify

and replace fearful self- talk and beliefs. (18, 19, 20, 21)

### 18. Explore the client's cognitive appraisals

that mediate his/her/their obsessional fears and compulsions; assist him/her/them in generating thoughts that correct for biases; use rational disputation and behavioral experiments to test fearful versus alternative predictions (see  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for OCD  by Clark).

### 19. Teach the client a guided self-dialogue

procedure in which he/she/they learn to recognize maladaptive self-talk, challenge its biases, cope with engendered feelings, overcome avoidance, and reinforce accomplishments; review and reinforce progress, problem-solve obstacles toward developing an effective consolidated approach.

### 20. Assign the client a homework exercise

in which he/she/they identify fearful self-talk, identify biases in the self-talk, generate alternatives, and test through behavioral experiments (or supplement


---

with “Journal and Replace Self- Defeating Thoughts” or “Reducing the Strength of Compulsive Behaviors” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma); review and reinforce success, providing corrective feedback toward sustained and effective implementation.

### 21. Use a metacognitive therapy approach

that examines the client's “thinking about his/her/their thinking” (i.e., the meaning he/she/they place on the intrusions and thoughts about responding versus not responding to them) toward developing a more adaptive plan based on a new, less threatening metacognitive appraisal of the intrusion (see  Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression  by Wells).

## 12.

Participate in imaginal or in vivo exposure to feared internal and/or external cues. (22, 23, 24, 25)

### 22. Assess the nature of any internal cues

(thoughts, images, and impulses) and external cues (e.g., persons, objects, and situations) that precipitate the client's obsessions and compulsions as well as any subtle or obvious safety (avoidant) behaviors (e.g., reassurance seeking, wearing concealing clothing for body dysmorphic disorder).

23. Assist the client in the construction of

hierarchies of feared internal and external fear cues.

### 24. Conduct exposure (imaginal and/or in

vivo) to the internal and/or external OCD cues (e.g., getting dirty, getting rid of some hoarded items, approach


---

subject of harming obsession) to test feared expectations; begin with exposures that have a high likelihood of being a successful experience for the client; include response prevention (i.e., not doing compulsions/safety behavior in response to anxiety) and do cognitive restructuring within and after the exposure to reinforce new learning; see Exposure and Response (Ritual) Prevention for OCD  by Foa et al.; Understanding and Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  by Abramowitz.

### 25. Assign the client homework exercises in

which he/she/they repeat the exposure to the internal and/or external OCD cues, using response prevention and restructured cognitions, and record responses; review during subsequent sessions, reinforcing success, problem- solving obstacles, and providing corrective feedback toward sustained improvement.

13.

Participate in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for OCD. (26, 27, 28, 29)

## 26. Use an ACT approach to OCD to help

the client accept and openly experience obsessive thoughts, images, and impulses without being overly affected by them, defusing them, and committing time and efforts to activities that are consistent with identified, personally meaningful values (see Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders  by Eifert et al.).

27. Teach mindfulness meditation to


---

improve present-focus skills, help the client recognize the negative thought processes associated with OCD, and change his/her/their relationship with these thoughts by accepting thoughts, images, and impulses that are reality based while noticing, but not reacting to, non-reality-based mental phenomena (see  Guided Mindfulness Meditation  [Audio CD Series] by Kabat- Zinn).

## 28. Assign the client homework in which

he/she/they practice lessons from mindfulness meditation and ACT in order to consolidate the approach in everyday life.

### 29. Assign the client reading consistent

with the mindfulness and ACT approach to supplement work done in session (see  The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety  by Forsyth and Eifert).

15. Identify

situations at

32. Identify and rehearse the management

of future situations or circumstances in


---

risk for a lapse and strategies for managing these risk situations. (32, 33, 34, 35)

which lapses could occur (i.e., high-risk situations).

### 33. Instruct the client to routinely use

strategies learned in therapy (e.g., continued everyday exposure, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving), building them into his/her/their life as much as possible to reinforce maintenance of current gains.

## 34. Develop a “coping card” or other

reminder on which coping strategies and other helpful information can be kept and consulted by the client as needed (e.g., steps in problem-solving, positive coping statements, other strategies that were helpful to the client during therapy).

## 35. Schedule periodic maintenance or

“booster” sessions to help the client maintain therapeutic gains and problem-solve challenges.

## 16. Implement a

refocusing cognition or behavior or an interruption via an unpleasant task to reduce the frequency and intensity of OCD thoughts and behaviors. (36, 37)

### 36. Ask the client to list repetitive thoughts

and/or behaviors and then identify and implement some positive, useful behavior that will interrupt the urges (or supplement with “Refocus Attention Away from Obsessions and Compulsions” in the  Adolescent Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma, Peterson, and McInnis).

## 37. Assign the client homework in which

he/she/they commit to performing a mutually agreed-upon unpleasant task to interrupt the urge to perform OCD ritual (or supplement with


---

“Interrupting Your Obsessions/ Compulsions” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma).

## 17. Implement

series of small steps toward breaking the hoarding pattern while sharing feelings and thoughts about the process. (38)

### 38. Ask the client to identify objects that

are saved or collected (hoarded) because he/she/they cannot throw or give them away, then solicit a commitment to get rid of one small object while sharing the feelings associated with this change in behavior; process the difficulty and reward the small step toward success; repeat (or supplement with “Decreasing What You Save and Collect” in the  Adolescent Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma, Peterson, and McInnis).

discuss unresolved life conflicts. (39, 40)

39. Explore the client's life circumstances

to help identify key unresolved conflicts that may underlie OCD.

## 40. Read with the client the fable “The

Friendly Forest” or “Round in Circles” from  Friedman's Fables  by Friedman, and then process using discussion questions.

19. Verbalize and

clarify feelings connected to key life conflicts. (41, 42)

## 41. Encourage, support, and assist the

client in identifying and expressing feelings related to key unresolved life issues.

### 42. Assess for secondary gains the client

may be receiving by remaining disordered with OCD (e.g., attention, care-receiving, avoidance of activity); directly address gains, if evident.


---

20. Accept or

work to resolve identified life conflicts. (43)

### 43. Explore the resolution of identified

interpersonal or other identified life conflicts; assist the client with acceptance of those that cannot be changed or use a conflict-resolution approach to address those that can.

## 21. Gain insight

into how childhood experiences might influence current struggles with OCD and take appropriate actions. (44)

## 44. Use an insight-oriented approach to

explore how current obsessive themes (e.g., cleanliness, symmetry, aggressive impulses) may be related to unresolved developmental conflicts (e.g., psychosexual, interpersonal); process toward the goal of insight and change.

22. Interpret

feared obsessions in a less threatening way. (45)

## 45. Conduct cognitive bias modification

training that asks the client to repeatedly interpret ambiguous scenarios toward shifting from a threat- oriented interpretation of intrusions to a more normalized and realistic one (see “Preliminary Evidence for the Enhancement of Self-Conducted Exposures for OCD Using Cognitive Bias Modification” by Amir et al.).

23. Engage in a

strategic ordeal to overcome OCD impulses. (46)

### 46. Create and sell a strategic ordeal that

offers a guaranteed cure to the client for the obsession or compulsion. (Note at the beginning of the therapy that Haley emphasizes that the “cure” offers an intervention to achieve a goal and is not a promise to cure the client; see  Ordeal Therapy  by Haley).


---

## 24. Develop and

implement a daily ritual that interrupts the current pattern of compulsions. (47)

### 47. Help the client create and implement a

ritual (e.g., find a job that the client finds necessary but very unpleasant, and have him/her/them do this job each time he/she/they find thought becoming obsessive); follow up with the client on the outcome of its implementation and make necessary adjustments.

### 30. Instruct the client to routinely use

strategies learned in therapy (e.g., cognitive restructuring, exposure), building them into his/her/their life as much as possible.


---

## 31. Develop a “coping card” on which

coping strategies and other important information (e.g., “Pace your breathing,” “Focus on the task at hand,” “You can manage it,” and “It will go away”) are recorded for the client's later use (or supplement with “Coping Card” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma).

### 32. Schedule a “booster session” for the

client for 1 to 3 months after therapy ends to track progress, reinforce gains, and problem-solve barriers.

17. Participate in

acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for panic disorder. (33, 34, 35, 36)

### 33. Use an ACT approach to help the client

accept and openly experience anxious thoughts and feelings without being overly affected by them, and committing time and efforts to activities that are consistent with identified, personally meaningful values (see  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders  by Eifert et al.).

## 34. Teach mindfulness meditation and

apply it to help the client adopt a more reflective than reflexive approach that is nonjudgmental, present focused, and counter to future-oriented worry and past-oriented rumination (see  Guided Mindfulness Meditation  [Audio CD] by Kabat-Zinn).

## 35. Assign the client homework in which

he/she/they practice lessons from mindfulness meditation and ACT in order to consolidate the approach into everyday life.


---

### 36. Assign the client reading consistent

with the mindfulness and ACT approach to supplement work done in session (see  The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety  by Forsyth and Eifert).

developmental conflicts that may be influencing current struggles with fear and avoidance and take appropriate actions. (38)

## 38. Use a panic-focused psychodynamic

approach to explore conflicts (e.g., separation/autonomy; anger recognition, management, and coping) that may be manifesting as fear and avoidance; address transference; work through separation and anger themes during therapy and upon termination toward developing a new ability to manage separations and autonomy.

20. Identify and

discuss unresolved life conflicts. (39)

22. Accept or

work to resolve identified life conflicts. (42)

### 42. Explore the resolution of identified

interpersonal or other identified life conflicts; assist the client with acceptance of those that cannot be changed or use a conflict-resolution approach to address those that can.

23. Implement

the Eriksonian task designed to face fear. (43)

### 43. Develop and assign an Eriksonian task

(see  Eriksonian Approaches  by Battino and South) that is consistent with the theme of the client's fears (e.g., the client fears traveling past a certain boundary, so ask the client to go to it, walk a certain number of steps past it, stop, allow anxiety to come and go, and repeat); process the results with the client.

## 24. Commit self to

not allowing the threat of panic symptoms to control decisions in life; take actions based on personal goals rather than fear and avoidance. (44)

### 44. Support the client in following through

with work, family, and social activities rather than escaping or avoiding them to focus on panic symptoms.

to increase activities that give meaning and expand his/her/their sense of identity at a time of transition in life phases (e.g., single to married, employed to homemaker, childless to


---

parent, employed to retired); monitor implementation; suggest the client read material on transitioning in life (e.g.,  Managing Transitions: Making the Most of Change  or Transitions:

Making Sense of Life's Changes  by Bridges).

14. Increase social

contacts to reduce sense of isolation. (28, 29)

### 28. Explore opportunities for the client to

overcome a sense of isolation (e.g., joining a community recreational or educational group, becoming active in church or synagogue activities, taking formal education classes, enrolling in an exercise group, joining a hobby support group); encourage implementation of these activities.

## 29. Use role-playing and modeling to

teach the client social skills needed to reach out to build new relationships such as starting conversations, introducing self, asking questions of others about himself/herself/themselves, smiling and being friendly, inviting new acquaintances to his/her/their home, and initiating a social engagement or activity with a new acquaintance (or supplement with “Observe Positive Social Behaviors” from the  Adolescent Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma, Peterson, and McInnis).

15. Share

emotional struggles related to current

### 30. Explore the client's feelings, coping

mechanisms, and support system as he/she/they try to adjust to the current life stress factors; assess for depth of depression, anxiety, or grief


---

adjustment stress. (30, 31) and recommend treatment focused on these problems if warranted (see the Depression—Unipolar, Anxiety, and Grief/Loss Unresolved chapters in this Planner ).

### 31. Assess the client for suicide potential if

feelings of depression, helplessness, and isolation are present; initiate suicide prevention precautions, if necessary (see the Suicidal Ideation chapter in this  Planner ).

16. Significant

others offer support to reduce the client's stress. (32)

### 32. Hold family therapy sessions in which

significant others are given the opportunity to support the client and offer suggestions for reducing stress; challenge the client to share needs assertively and challenge significant others to take responsibility for support (e.g., partner to increasing parenting involvement, partner to support the client's need for affirmation and stimulation outside the home, family members to take more responsibility for elderly parent's care).

17. Read self-help

book on the difficult transition life is presenting currently. (33)

### 33. Suggest reading material to the client

on making the transition that is stressful (e.g., new marriage, new parent, becoming full-time homemaker, providing care to an aging parent, retirement, or adjusting to an “empty nest”); consult the Bibliotherapy Suggestions in Appendix A for selected titles.

## SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS

## 1. Work

cooperatively with the therapist toward agreed- upon therapeutic goals while being as open and honest as comfort and trust allows. (1, 2)

## 1. Establish rapport with the client

toward building a strong therapeutic alliance; convey caring, support, warmth, and empathy; provide nonjudgmental support and develop a level of trust with the client toward feeling safe to discuss the phobic fears and their impact on his/her/their life.

## 2. Strengthen powerful relationship

factors within the therapy process and foster the therapy alliance through paying special attention to these


---

empirically supported factors: work collaboratively  with the client in the treatment process; reach agreement on the  goals and expectations  of therapy; demonstrate  consistent empathy  toward the client's feelings and struggles; verbalize  positive regard  toward and  affirmation  of the client; and collect and deliver  client feedback  as to the client's perception of his/her/their progress in therapy (see  Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Vol. 1  by Norcross and Lambert and  Vol. 2  by Norcross and Wampold).

## 2. Describe the

history and nature of the phobia(s), complete with impact on functioning and attempts to overcome it. (3)

### 3. Assess the client's fear and avoidance,

including the objects and situations that precipitate the fear, the nature and focus of the fear, types of avoidance/safety behaviors (e.g., distraction, escape, dependence on others), development of the fear, and disability resulting from the fear (or supplement with a semistructured interview such as  The Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule–Adult Version ).

3. Complete

psychological tests designed to assess features of the phobia. (4)

## 4. Administer a client-report measure

(e.g., “Measures for Specific Phobia” by Antony; the  Fear Survey Schedule–III) to further assess the depth and breadth of phobic responses; readminister as needed to assess treatment outcome.

4. Participate in a  5. Conduct a behavioral assessment task


---

## behavioral assessment task. (5)

in which the client is asked to approach, under his/her own direction, the feared object or situation while reporting relevant cognitive and emotional experiences; readminister as needed to assess treatment outcome.

## 5. Disclose any

history of substance use that may contribute to and complicate the treatment of the phobia. (6)

## 6. Arrange for a substance abuse

evaluation and refer the client for treatment if the evaluation recommends it (see the Substance Use chapter in this  Planner ).

## 6. Provide

behavioral, emotional, and attitudinal information toward an assessment of specifiers relevant to a DSM  diagnosis, the efficacy of treatment, and the nature of the therapy relationship. (7, 8, 9, 10)

## 7. Assess the client's level of insight

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others' concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 8. Assess the client for evidence of

research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression secondary to an anxiety disorder)


---

including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

### 9. Assess for any issues of age, gender,

or culture that could help explain the client's currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a better understanding of the client's behavior.

### 10. Assess for the severity of the level of

impairment to the client's functioning to determine appropriate level of care (e.g., the behavior noted creates mild, moderate, severe, or very severe impairment in social, relational, vocational, or occupational endeavors); continuously assess this severity of impairment as well as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates severe impairment but the presenting problem now is causing mild or moderate impairment).

7. Cooperate with

an evaluation by a prescriber for psychotropic medication. (11, 12)

## 11. Arrange for a medication evaluation

to determine the need for a prescription of psychotropic medications if the client requests it or if the client is likely to be nonadherent with the recommended gradual exposure without medication assistance.

## 12. Monitor the client for prescription

adherence, side effects, and overall effectiveness of the medication; consult with the prescriber at regular


---

intervals.

## 8. Verbalize

an accurate understanding of information about phobias and their treatment. (13, 14, 15)

## 13. Discuss how phobias are common but

unwarranted expressions of our fight or flight response, are not a sign of weakness, but may cause unnecessary distress and disability.

### 14. Discuss how phobic fear is maintained

by a “phobic cycle” of unwarranted fear and avoidance that precludes positive, corrective learning experiences with the feared object or situation, and how treatment breaks the cycle by encouraging exposure to these experiences (see  Mastering Your Fears and Phobias:  Therapist Guide  by Craske, Antony, and Barlow; Specific Phobias  by Bruce and Sanderson).

## 15. Assign the client to read

psychoeducational chapters of books or treatment manuals on specific phobias (e.g.,  The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook  by Bourne;  Living with Fear  by Marks;  Mastering Your Fears and Phobia: Workbook  by Antony, Craske, and Barlow;  Anxiety, Phobias, and Panic  by Peurifoy;  Face Your Fears  by Tolin).

domain toward breaking the cycle and learning actual safety and manageability (see  Mastering Your Fears and Phobias: Therapist Guide by Craske, Antony, and Barlow; Specific Phobias  by Bruce and Sanderson).

## 17. Discuss how exposure serves as an

arena to extinguish learned fear, build confidence, and feel safer by building a new history of success experiences (see  Mastering Your Fears and Phobias: Therapist Guide  by Craske, Antony, and Barlow;  Specific Phobias by Bruce and Sanderson).

## 10. Learn and

implement calming skills to reduce and manage anxiety symptoms that may emerge during encounters with phobic objects or situations. (18, 19, 20)

## 18. Teach the client anxiety management

skills (e.g., staying focused on behavioral goals, physiological calming such as relaxation and paced breathing, positive self-talk) to address anxiety symptoms that may emerge during encounters with phobic objects or situations (or supplement with “Four Ways to Reduce Fear” from the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner by Jongsma).

### 19. Assign the client a homework exercise

in which he/she/they practice daily calming skills; review and reinforce success, problem-solve obstacles toward mastery of the skill (or supplement with “Deep Breathing Exercise” from the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner by Jongsma or “Progressive Muscle


---

Relaxation” from the  Adolescent Psychotherapy Homework Planner by Jongsma, Peterson, and McInnis).

20. Use biofeedback techniques to

facilitate the client's success at learning calming skills.

11. Learn and

implement applied muscle tension skills. (21, 22)

## 21. To prevent syncope during exposure

to blood, injection, and injury phobic cues, teach the client applied tension in which he/she/they temporarily tense neck and upper torso muscles to curtail blood flow out of the brain to help prevent fainting upon the initiation of an exposure (consult “Applied Tension” by Öst and Sterner).

### 22. Assign the client a homework exercise

in which he/she/they practice daily applied tension skills; review and reinforce success, problem-solve obstacles toward mastery of the skill.

## 12. Identify,

challenge, and replace biased, fearful self-talk with positive, realistic, and empowering self-talk. (23, 24, 25)

## 23. Explore the client's cognitive

appraisals and beliefs that mediate his/her phobic response; assist in identifying biases, generate alternative predictions that correct for the biases; and conduct behavioral experiments (i.e., exposures) to test and ultimately switch belief from the biased to the alternative prediction/belief.

24. Assign the client a homework exercise

in which he/she/they identify fearful


---

self-talk and create reality-based alternatives that will be tested with behavioral experiments (or supplement with “Journal and Replace Self-Defeating Thoughts” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma); review and reinforce success, problem-solve obstacles toward mastery of the skill.

## 25. Use behavioral techniques (e.g.,

modeling, corrective feedback, imaginal rehearsal, social reinforcement) to teach the client cognitive coping skills (e.g., attentional focus on goals; positive, motivating self-talk) for use during behavioral experiments.

## 13. Participate

in imaginal/virtual reality/live exposure exercises to feared or avoided phobic objects or situations. (26, 27, 28, 29)

## 26. Direct and assist the client in

construction of a hierarchy of anxiety- producing situations associated with the phobic response; include imaginal situations if needed to accommodate excessive fear.

### 27. Select initial exposures that have a

high likelihood of being a successful experience for the client; develop a plan for managing the symptoms and rehearse the plan.

### 28. Conduct initial exposure exercises in

session then assign them as a homework exercise that the client does and records responses (or supplement with “Gradually Reducing Your Phobic Fear” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner


---

by Jongsma;  Mastering Your Fears and Phobia: Workbook  by Antony, Craske, and Barlow;  Living with Fear by Marks); review and reinforce success, problem-solve obstacles toward sufficient extinction of fear and elimination of phobic avoidance.

## 29. Assign the client behavioral

experiments in which biased, fear- based predictions are tested against alternatives that correct for the biases during exposure exercises; review and reinforce success, problem-solve obstacles toward convincing belief in the alternatives and the elimination of phobic avoidance.

## 14. Implement

relapse prevention strategies for preventing and/or managing possible future anxiety symptoms. (30, 31, 32, 33, 34)

### 30. Discuss with the client the distinction

between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a temporary and reversible return of symptoms, fear, or urges to avoid and relapse with the decision to return to fearful and avoidant patterns.

### 31. Identify and rehearse with the client

the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur.

### 32. Instruct the client to routinely use

strategies learned in therapy (e.g., cognitive restructuring, exposure), building them into his/her/their life as much as possible.

33. Develop a “coping card” or other

record on which coping strategies and


---

other therapeutic important information that the client found useful (e.g., coping strategies, cognitive messages) are made available for the client's later use.

### 34. Schedule a “booster session” for the

client 1 to 3 months after therapy ends to reinforce gains and problem-solve any obstacles to progress.

## 15. Learn to accept

anxious thinking and tolerate, rather than avoid, unpleasant emotions while accomplishing meaningful goals. (35, 36, 37)

## 35. Use an acceptance and commitment

therapy (ACT) approach including mindfulness strategies to help the client decrease experiential avoidance, disconnect thoughts from actions, accept one's experience rather than change or control symptoms, and behave according to broader life values; assist the client in clarifying values and goals and commit to behaving accordingly (see  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders  by Eifert, Forsyth, and Hayes).

### 36. Recommend that the client read self-

help books consistent with the ACT approach to help supplement therapy and foster better understanding of it (e.g., see  The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety  by Forsyth and Eifert); process material read.

## 37. Support the client in following

through with commitments toward having a meaningful and fulfilling work, family, and social life.


---

16. Verbalize the

costs and benefits of remaining fearful and avoidant. (38)

## 38. Probe for the presence of secondary

gain that reinforces the client's phobic actions through escape or avoidance mechanisms; address gain directly if evident; encourage and support change.

## 17. Verbalize the

separate realities of the irrationally feared object or situation and the emotionally painful experience from the past that has been evoked by the phobic stimulus. (39, 40, 41)

39. Clarify and differentiate between the

client's current irrational fear and past emotional pain.

## 40. Encourage the client's sharing of

feelings associated with past traumas through active listening, positive regard, and questioning (or supplement with “Describe the Trauma” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma).

41. Work through past pain with the

client toward insight into its relationship with the present fear.

## 30. Use cognitive behavioral techniques

(e.g., covert modeling [i.e., imagining the successful use of the strategies], role-play, practice, and generalization training) to teach the client tailored skills (e.g., calming and coping skills) for managing fears, overcoming avoidance, and increasing present-day adaptation (see  Clinician's Guide to Treating PTSD  by Taylor).

17. Learn

and implement guided self- dialog to manage thoughts, feelings, and

(33)

## 20.

Participate in an individual or group narrative exposure therapy that explores ways in which trauma may fit into the one's life story. (34)

## 34. For complex or multiple traumas

relationship factors within the


---

therapy process and foster the therapy alliance through paying special attention to these empirically supported factors: work  collaboratively  with the client in the treatment process; reach agreement on the  goals and expectations  of therapy; demonstrate  consistent empathy  toward the client's feelings and struggles; verbalize positive regard  toward and affirmation  of the client; and collect and deliver  client feedback  as to the client's perception of his/her/their progress in therapy (see Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Vol. 1  by Norcross and Lambert and  Vol. 2  by Norcross and Wampold).

psychological tests designed to assess the nature and severity of

## 4. Administer a measure of social

anxiety to further assess the depth and breadth of social fears and avoidance (e.g., the

emotional, and attitudinal information toward an assessment of specifiers relevant to a DSM  diagnosis, the efficacy of treatment, and the nature of the therapy relationship. (6, 7, 8, 9)

## 6. Assess the client's level of

insight (syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others' concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 7. Assess the client for evidence of

research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression secondary


---

to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

derives from cognitive biases that overestimate the likelihood and severity of negative evaluation by others, undervalue the self, distress, and often lead to unnecessary avoidance.

## 14. Assign the client to read

psychoeducational chapters of books or treatment manuals on social anxiety that explain the cycle of social anxiety and avoidance and the rationale for cognitive behavioral treatment (e.g.,  Overcoming Social Anxiety and Shyness  by Butler; The Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook  by Antony and Swinson;  Managing Social


---

Anxiety  by Hope, Heimberg, and Turk).

## 10. Verbalize an

understanding of the rationale for cognitive-behavioral treatment of social anxiety. (15)

attention and misinterpretation of social cues in generating social anxiety; generate and implement strategies that focus and interpret social cues in a more realistic and accepting manner.

## 13. Learn and

implement social skills to reduce anxiety and build confidence in social interactions. (19, 20, 21)

## 19. Use instruction, modeling, and

behavioral experiments/exposure to feared social situations within and outside of therapy. (22, 23, 24)

## 22. Direct and assist the client in

construction of a hierarchy of anxiety-producing situations associated with the phobic response as well as safety behaviors in which the client engages to avoid uninhibited social engagement.

## 23. Select initial in vivo or role-

played exposures that have a high likelihood of being a successful learning experience for the client; target the gradual removal of safety behaviors (e.g., making eye contact, responding more demonstratively to others); do cognitive restructuring within

and/or after the exposure, use behavioral strategies (e.g., modeling, rehearsal, social reinforcement) to facilitate progress through the hierarchy (see  Managing Social Anxiety by Hope et al.).

## 24. Assign the client a homework

exercise in which he/she/they do behavioral experiments/exposure exercises and records responses (or supplement with “Gradually Reducing Your Phobic Fear” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma; also see  The Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook by Antony and Swinson; review and reinforce success, problem- solve obstacles toward sustained improvement.

## 15. Implement

relapse prevention strategies for managing possible future anxiety symptoms. (25, 26, 27, 28)

acceptance- and mindfulness-based therapy for social anxiety. (29, 30, 31, 32)

## 29. Use approaches from

acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to help the client accept and openly experience anxious thoughts and feelings without being overly impacted by them, shifting focus and committing time and efforts to activities that are consistent with identified, personally meaningful values (see Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders by Eifert, Forsyth, and Hayes).

## 30. Teach mindfulness meditation

to help the client shift focus from judgmental and critical cognition to a more accepting and present focus, to recognize the negative thought processes


---

associated with social anxiety and change his/her/their relationship with these thoughts by accepting thoughts, images, and impulses that are reality- based while noticing, but not reacting to, non-reality-based mental phenomena (or supplement with  Guided Mindfulness Meditation  [Audio CD Series] by Kabat-Zinn).

## 31. Assign the client homework in

which he/she/they practice lessons from mindfulness meditation and ACT in order to consolidate the approach into in everyday life.

## 32. Assign the client reading

consistent with the mindfulness and ACT approach to supplement work done in session (e.g.,  The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety  by Forsyth and Eifert).

people in life, past and present, and describe the quality, good and poor, of those relationships. (33)

## 33. Conduct interpersonal therapy

beginning with the assessment of the client's “interpersonal inventory” of important past and present relationships; develop a case formulation linking social anxiety to unresolved grief, interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, and/or interpersonal deficits (see The  Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy  by Weissman et


---

al.).

## 18. Verbalize and

demonstrate an understanding and resolution of current interpersonal problems. (34, 35, 36, 37)

## 36. For role transitions (e.g.,

beginning or ending a relationship or career, moving, promotion, retirement, graduation), help the client mourn the loss of the old role while recognizing positive and negative aspects of the new role, and taking steps to gain mastery over the new role.

## 37. For interpersonal deficits, help

the client develop new interpersonal skills to enhance existing relationships and/or create new ones.

19. Explore past

experiences that may

38. Probe childhood experiences of

criticism, abandonment, or

books  Healing the Shame That Binds You  by Bradshaw and Facing Shame  by Fossum and Mason, and process key ideas.

## 20. Work through

developmental conflicts that may be influencing current struggles with fear and avoidance and take appropriate present-day actions. (40)

## 40. Use an insight-oriented

approach to explore how psychodynamic conflicts (e.g., internalized representations of others who shamed, criticized, abandoned, humiliated client; repressed sexual or aggressive wishes); address transference; work through personally relevant themes during therapy and upon termination toward developing new approaches to social interaction and reducing vulnerabilities to influences from the past.

## 21. Revisit early

memories unpleasant social situations from different perspectives toward seeing them in a new way. (41, 42)

## 41. Conduct imagery rescripting in

which early memories are imaged and discussed from different points of view including the client as the (vulnerable) child and then as the (mature and experienced) adult, and/or with a new, desired outcome; process toward updating the meaning of the event and separating the past meaning from the present


---

one (consult  Imagery Rescripting as a Therapeutic Technique  by Arntz).

## 42. Help the client incorporate the

new meaning into present situations in which the past memory is provoked or has been influencing present-day responding.

22. Verbally describe the

defense mechanisms used to avoid close relationships. (43)

## 43. Assist the client in identifying

defense mechanisms that keep others at a distance and prevent him/her/them from developing trusting relationships; identify ways to minimize defensiveness.

session to track progress, reinforce gains, and problem- solve barriers. (44)

## 44. Schedule a follow-up or

“booster session” for the client for 1 to 3 months after therapy ends to track progress.

## SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS

## 1. Work

cooperatively with the therapist toward agreed- upon therapeutic goals while being as open and honest as comfort and trust allows. (1, 2)

## 1. Establish rapport with the client

toward building a strong therapeutic alliance; convey caring, support, warmth, and empathy; provide nonjudgmental support and develop a level of trust with the client toward feeling safe to discuss suicidal thoughts, feelings, and actions and the impact on his/her/their life.

## 2. Strengthen powerful relationship

factors within the therapy process and foster the therapy alliance through paying special attention to these


---

empirically supported factors: work collaboratively  with the client in the treatment process; reach agreement on the  goals and expectations  of therapy; demonstrate  consistent empathy toward the client's feelings and struggles; verbalize  positive regard toward and  affirmation  of the client; and collect and deliver  client feedback as to the client's perception of his/her/their progress in therapy (see Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Vol. 1  by Norcross and Lambert and  Vol. 2  by Norcross and Wampold).

## 2. Honestly share

suicidal thoughts, feelings, and actions including intent, plan, and past attempts. (3, 4, 5, 6)

## 3. Assess the client's suicidal risk

including the extent of his/her/their ideation, the presence and feasibility of a plan, past attempts, availability of means, family history, and other risk (e.g., hopelessness, self-hate) and protective factors (e.g., social support, reasons for living).

## 4. With consent, obtain collateral

information from significant others to facilitate assessment of suicide risk; ask them to form a 24-hour suicide watch until the crisis subsides, if warranted.

## 5. Arrange or conduct psychometric

testing to further assess suicidal behavior and/or related conditions (e.g.,  The Suicidal Thinking and Behaviors Questionnaire; the Beck Hopelessness Scale ; The Reasons for Living Scale); use with other sources of information to assess the client's


---

suicide risk.

## 6. Assess and monitor the client's

suicidal potential in an ongoing manner with sensitivity toward risk factors such as IS PATH WARM (Ideation, Substance use, Purposelessness, Agitation, Trapped, Hopelessness, Withdrawal, Anger, Recklessness, and Mood changes; see IS PATH WARM?  by Juhnke et al.).

## 3. Disclose any

history of substance use that may contribute to and complicate the treatment of suicidal ideation. (7)

evaluation and refer the client for treatment if the evaluation recommends it (see the Substance Use chapter in this  Planner ).

## 4. Provide

behavioral, emotional, and attitudinal information toward an assessment of specifiers relevant to a DSM  diagnosis, the efficacy of treatment, and the nature of the therapy relationship. (8, 9, 10, 11)

## 8. Assess the client's level of insight

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others' concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

9. Assess the client for evidence of

research-based correlated disorders


---

(e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

### 10. Assess for any issues of age, gender, or

culture that could help explain the client's currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a better understanding of the client's behavior.

### 11. Assess for the severity of the level of

impairment to the client's functioning to determine appropriate level of care (e.g., the behavior noted creates mild, moderate, severe, or very severe impairment in social, relational, vocational, or occupational endeavors); continuously assess this severity of impairment as well as the efficacy of treatment (e.g., the client no longer demonstrates severe impairment but the presenting problem now is causing mild or moderate impairment).

## 5. Explore

and resolve ambivalence associated with commitment to engage in therapy for suicidal vulnerabilities.

## 12. Using a motivational interviewing

approach explore the client's motivation for change and whether the client is ready to take active therapeutic steps or would benefit from continued motivational interviewing (see  Motivational Interviewing  by Miller and Rollnick).


---

(12)

## 6. Work

cooperatively with the therapist, completing the Suicide Status Form, and collaboratively developing a plan for addressing suicidal thoughts and feelings. (13)

## 13. Using a CAMS (Collaborative

Assessment and Management of Suicidality) approach, sit next to the client and using a conversational style collaboratively complete the  Suicide Status Form  (SSF) to assess risk and protective factors toward developing a crisis response plan and an ongoing treatment plan; repeat each session until risk is reliably low (i.e., a minimum of three sessions without suicidality; see  Managing Suicidal Risk  by Jobes).

## 7. Identify

and record personal warning signs that signal a suicide crisis is developing. (14)

## 14. With the client, develop a crisis

response plan starting with the identification of the client's personal warning signs/“suicide drivers” (including key signs such as psychological pain [anguish], stress [overwhelmed], agitation [urgency], hopelessness, and self-hate); educate the client about these signs and their use as indicators to implement the crisis response plan; record signs on a “crisis card” for the client's later use as a reminder of the plan.

8. Identify

and record on a crisis card personal reasons for living. (15)

### 15. Discuss, identify, and record on crisis

card the client's reasons for living; or supplement with use of the Reasons for Living Scale and/or the  SSF; if agreed by the client, create a box of reminders of the identified reasons for living (i.e., a “hope kit,” or “survival

strategies for coping with the suicide crisis that include self-soothing and identifying social and professional supports. (16, 17, 18)

## 16. Teach the client self-soothing and

coping strategies to be used in response to warning signs to ride out intense moments toward achieving a calmer state and then behaving toward identified support (e.g., splashing face with cold water to break high distress, mindfulness of the current emotion, paced breathing, relaxation, and opposite action/behavioral activation toward support); record strategies on the crisis card.

### 17. Identify social supports who agree to

be called or seen by the client during a crisis 24 hours a day; record contact information on the crisis card; educate client on use of support to realign thoughts and actions with reasons for living.

## 18. Identify professional support

resources for the client to contact if in crisis (e.g., mental health provider, mental health on-call service, suicide hotline); record contact information on the crisis card.

## 10.

Implement the use of a “crisis card” that lists the steps of a crisis response plan. (19, 20)

### 19. Complete and provide the client with a

“crisis card” that records the crisis response plan including warning signs, reasons for living, coping strategies, social and professional support contact information; educate the client about its use during crisis.

20. Offer to be available to the client

through telephone contact if a life-


---

threatening urge develops and previous steps of the crisis response plan are insufficient.

## 11. Client

and/or significant others increase the safety of the home by removing firearms or other potentially lethal means to suicide from easy access. (21)

## 21. Encourage the client and/or

significant others to remove firearms, medications, knives, or other lethal means to suicide from easy access; process the client's feelings about this prevention measure; with significant others appeal to the shared value of protecting the safety of his/her/their loved one.

with hospitalization if the suicidal urge becomes uncontrollable. (22)

### 22. Arrange for hospitalization when the

client is judged to be uncontrollably harmful to self; arrange for legal commitment to a hospital, if necessary, to protect the client from self-harm.

### 25. Assess the client for disorders in which

suicidality is functionally related to the clinical syndrome such as unipolar or bipolar depression, or borderline personality disorder (See appropriate chapters in this  Planner ).

## 16. Learn and

implement calming and self-soothing skills to regulate emotional reactivity. (26, 27)

## 26. Teach the client calming and self-

soothing skills such as TIPP skills (Temperature reduction by splashing face in cold water, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, and Paired muscle relaxation) to calm intense emotion, discharge tension, and/or calm overarousal; educate the client in their use as part of an overall emotional regulation skill set (see  DBT Skills Training Manual  by Linehan).

## 27. Teach the client mindfulness

meditation skills for developing a present-focused, nonjudgmental approach to everyday life and as an emotion regulation skill.

challenging, and changing biased cognition (e.g., triggering shame, guilt, hopelessness, self-hate, suicide); work with client to develop alternatives that correct for the biases (or supplement with “Journal of Distorted, Negative Thoughts” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma).

### 31. Direct the client to repeatedly test new

cognitive appraisals through behavioral experiments toward facilitating a sustained and effective change in beliefs and self-talk functionally linked to previous suicidal thought and behavior (e.g., thoughts of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, catastrophizing, negatively predicting the future, etc.).

19. Learn and  32. Use a problem-solving therapy


---

implement problem- solving and decision- making skills. (32, 33)

approach (see  Problem-Solving Therapy  by D'Zurilla and Nezu) involving psychoeducation, modeling, and role-playing to teach client to apply problem-solving skills to daily life issues (i.e., defining a problem specifically, generating possible solutions, evaluating the pros and cons of each solution, selecting and implementing a plan of action, evaluating the efficacy of the plan, accepting or revising the plan) (or supplement with “Applying Problem- Solving to Interpersonal Conflict” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner  by Jongsma).

## 33. Encourage in the client the

development of a positive problem orientation in which problems and solving them are viewed as a common and natural part of life, a valued personal skill, and not something to be despaired, approached passively, or avoided.

## 20. Learn and

implement behavioral strategies designed to increase engagement in rewarding activities. (34, 35)

## 34. Use behavioral techniques such as

instruction, rehearsal, role-playing, or role reversal, as needed, to engage the client in “behavioral activation,” that increases his/her/their activity level and contact with sources of reward and support, while identifying processes that inhibit activation (see Behavioral Activation for Depression by Martell, Dimidjian, and Herman- Dunn; or supplement with “Identify and Schedule Pleasant Activities” in the  Adult Psychotherapy Homework

21. Learn and

implement relapse prevention skills. (36, 37, 38, 39)

### 36. Discuss with the client the distinction

between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a rather common, temporary setback that may involve, for example, reexperiencing a depressive thought and/or urge to withdraw or avoid (perhaps as related to some loss or conflict) and a relapse as a sustained return to a pattern of depressive thinking and feeling usually accompanied by interpersonal withdrawal and/or avoidance.

### 37. Identify and rehearse with the client

the management of early warning signs of relapse; rehearsing the use of skills learned during therapy to manage them.

38. Send a postcard or letter to the client

with a brief expression of caring and best wishes.

feeling safe to discuss vocational stress and its impact on his/her/their life.

## 2. Strengthen powerful relationship

factors within the therapy process and foster the therapy alliance through paying special attention to these empirically supported factors: work collaboratively  with the client in the treatment process; reach agreement on the  goals and expectations  of therapy; demonstrate  consistent empathy toward the client's feelings and struggles; verbalize  positive regard toward and  affirmation  of the client; and collect and deliver  client feedback as to the client's perception of his/her/their progress in therapy (see Psychotherapy  Relationships That Work: Vol. 1  by Norcross and Lambert and  Vol. 2  by Norcross and Wampold).

(syntonic versus dystonic) toward the “presenting problems” (e.g., demonstrates good insight into the problematic nature of the “described behavior,” agrees with others' concern, and is motivated to work on change; demonstrates ambivalence regarding the “problem described” and is reluctant to address the issue as a concern; or demonstrates resistance regarding acknowledgment of the “problem described,” is not concerned, and has no motivation to change).

## 7. Assess the client for evidence of

research-based correlated disorders (e.g., oppositional defiant behavior with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], depression secondary to an anxiety disorder) including vulnerability to suicide, if appropriate (e.g., increased suicide risk when comorbid depression is evident).

culture that could help explain the client's currently defined “problem behavior” and factors that could offer a


---

better understanding of the client's behavior.

## APPENDIX C RECOVERY MODEL OBJECTIVES AND INTERVENTIONS

The Objectives and Interventions that follow are created around the 10 core principles developed by a multidisciplinary panel at the 2004 National Consensus Conference on Mental Health Recovery and Mental Health Systems Transformation convened by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2004):

1. Self-direction:  Consumers lead, control, exercise choice over, and

determine their own path of recovery by optimizing autonomy, independence, and control of resources to achieve a self-determined life. By definition, the recovery process must be self-directed by the individual, who defines their own life goals and designs a unique path toward those goals.

### 2. Individualized and person centered:  There are multiple

pathways to recovery based on an individual's unique strengths and resiliencies as well as needs, preferences, experiences (including past trauma), and cultural background in all of its diverse representations. Individuals also identify recovery as being an ongoing journey and an end result as well as an overall paradigm for achieving wellness and optimal mental health.

3. Empowerment:  Consumers have the authority to choose from a

range of options and to participate in all decisions—including the allocation of resources—that will affect their lives, and are educated and supported in so doing. They have the ability to join with other consumers to speak for themselves collectively and effectively about their needs, wants, desires, and aspirations. Through empowerment, an individual gains control of their own destiny and influences the organizational and societal structures in their life.

4. Holistic:  Recovery encompasses an individual's whole life,

including mind, body, spirit, and community. Recovery embraces all aspects of life, including housing, employment, education, mental health and health care treatment and services, complementary and


---

naturalistic services, addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation, and family supports as determined by the person. Families, providers, organizations, systems, communities, and society play crucial roles in creating and maintaining meaningful opportunities for consumer access to these supports.

5. Nonlinear:  Recovery is not a step-by-step process but one based on

continual growth, occasional setbacks, and learning from experience. Recovery begins with an initial stage of awareness in which a person recognizes that positive change is possible. This awareness enables the consumer to move on to fully engage in the work of recovery.

6. Strengths based:  Recovery focuses on valuing and building on the

multiple capacities, resiliencies, talents, coping abilities, and inherent worth of individuals. By building on these strengths, consumers leave stymied life roles behind and engage in new life roles (e.g., partner, caregiver, friend, student, employee). The process of recovery moves forward through interaction with others in supportive, trust-based relationships.

### 7. Peer support:  Mutual support—including the sharing of

experiential knowledge and skills and social learning—plays an invaluable role in recovery. Consumers encourage and engage other consumers in recovery and provide each other with a sense of belonging, supportive relationships, valued roles, and community.

8. Respect:  Community, systems, and societal acceptance and

appreciation of consumers—including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination and stigma—are crucial in achieving recovery. Self-acceptance and regaining belief in oneself are particularly vital. Respect ensures the inclusion and full participation of consumers in all aspects of their lives.

9. Responsibility:  Consumers have a personal responsibility for their

own self-care and journeys of recovery. Taking steps toward their goals may require great courage. Consumers must strive to understand and give meaning to their experiences and identify coping strategies and healing processes to promote their own wellness.

10. Hope:  Recovery provides the essential and motivating message of a


---

better future—that people can overcome the barriers and obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized but can be fostered by peers, families, friends, providers, and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. Mental health recovery not only benefits individuals with mental health disabilities by focusing on their abilities to live, work, learn, and fully participate in our society but also enriches the texture of U.S. community life. The United States reaps the benefits of the contributions individuals with mental disabilities can make, ultimately becoming a stronger and healthier nation.

## 1

The numbers used for Objectives in the treatment plan correspond to the numbers for the 10 core principles. Each of the 10 Objectives was written to capture the essential theme of the like-numbered core principle. The numbers in parentheses after the Objectives denote the Interventions designed to assist the client in attaining each respective Objective. The clinician may select any or all of the Objectives and Intervention statements to include in the client's treatment plan.

One generic Long-Term Goal statement is offered should the clinician desire to emphasize a recovery model orientation in the client's treatment plan.


---

## LONG-TERM GOALS

1. To live a meaningful life in a self-selected community while striving

to achieve full potential during the journey of healing and transformation.

## SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS

## 1. Make it

clear to therapist, family, and friends what path to recovery is preferred. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

### 1. Explore the client's thoughts, needs,

and preferences regarding the desired pathway to recovery from depression, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, etc.

## 2. Strengthen powerful relationship

factors within the therapy process and foster the therapy alliance through paying special attention to these empirically supported factors: work collaboratively  with the client in the treatment process; reach agreement on the  goals and expectations  of therapy; demonstrate  consistent empathy toward the client's feelings and struggles; verbalize  positive regard toward and  affirmation  of the client; and collect and deliver  client feedback as to the client's perception of his/her/their progress in therapy (see Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Vol. 1  by Norcross and Lambert and  Vol. 2  by Norcross and Wampold).

### 3. Discuss with the client the alternative

treatment interventions and community support resources that might facilitate recovery.


---

### 4. Solicit the client's preferences regarding

the direction treatment will take; allow for these preferences to be communicated to family and significant others.

5. Discuss and process with the client the

possible outcomes that may result from his/her/their decisions.

## 2. Specify any

unique needs and cultural preferences that must be taken under consideration during the treatment process. (6, 7)

## 6. Explore with the client any cultural

considerations, experiences, or other needs that must be considered in formulating a mutually agreed-upon treatment plan.

7. Modify treatment planning to

accommodate the client's cultural and experiential background and preferences.

## 3. Verbalize an

understanding that decision- making throughout the treatment process is self- controlled. (8, 9)

### 8. Clarify with the client that he/she/they

have the right to choose and select among options and participate in all decisions that affect the client during treatment.

### 9. Continuously offer and explain options

to the client as treatment progresses in support of his/her/their sense of empowerment, encouraging and reinforcing the client's participation in treatment decision-making.

4. Express

mental, physical, spiritual and community needs and

10. Assess the client's personal,

interpersonal, medical, spiritual, and community strengths and weaknesses.

11. Maintain a holistic approach to

treatment planning by integrating the


---

desires that should be integrated into the treatment process. (10, 11)

client's unique mental, physical, spiritual, and community needs and assets into the plan; arrive at an agreement with the client as to how these integrations will be made.

## 5. Verbalize an

understanding that during the treatment process there will be successes and failures, progress, and setbacks. (12, 13)

### 12. Facilitate realistic expectations and

hope in the client that positive change is possible but does not occur in a linear process of straight-line successes; emphasize a recovery process involving growth, learning from advances as well as setbacks, and staying this course toward recovery.

13. Convey to the client that you will stay

the course with him/her/them through the difficult times of lapses and setbacks.

## 6. Cooperate

with an assessment of personal strengths and assets brought to the treatment process. (14, 15, 16)

### 14. Administer to the client the  Behavioral

and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS): A Strength-Based Approach to Assessment  by Epstein.

### 15. Identify the client's strengths through a

thorough assessment involving social, cognitive, relational, and spiritual aspects of the client's life; assist the client in identifying what coping skills have worked well in the past to overcome problems and what talents and abilities characterize daily life.

## 16. Provide feedback to the client of

his/her/their identified strengths and how these strengths can be integrated into short-term and long-term recovery


---

planning.

## 7. Verbalize an

understanding of the benefits of peer support during the recovery process. (17, 18, 19)

### 17. Discuss with the client the benefits of

peer support (e.g., sharing common problems, receiving advice regarding successful coping skills, getting encouragement, learning of helpful community resources, etc.) toward the client's agreement to engage in peer activity.

### 18. Refer the client to peer support groups

of his/her/their choice in the community and process the experience with follow-through.

### 19. Build and reinforce the client's sense of

belonging, supportive relationship building, social value, and community integration by processing the gains and problem-solving the obstacles encountered through the client's social activities.

## 8. Agree to

reveal when any occasion arises that respect is not felt from the treatment staff, family, self, or the community. (20, 21, 22)

### 20. Discuss with the client the crucial role

that respect plays in recovery, reviewing subtle and obvious ways in which disrespect may be shown to or experienced by the client.

21. Review ways in which the client has felt

disrespected in the past, identifying sources of that disrespect.

### 22. Encourage and reinforce the client's

self-concept as a person deserving of respect; advocate for the client to increase incidents of respectful treatment within the community and/or family system.


---
